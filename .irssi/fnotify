sean john says irissi doesnt handle invites well
sean so...
sean you were invited to #hypermedia
#hypermedia < john> aturley: really?
john I used to sshs jobseeker-1 (after I'd already sshs-copy-id'd to it), then just passwd until I remembered the password
john that way, no lockout
john hm, you have ssh -N sshgw &! running?
john so many rabbit holes
john the ol' restart hatery
john I should give you my home .ssh/config too
john home/macbook
john so you can ssh/vnc into your work machine
john my first three weeks, I was using reverse tunnels
john so when my desktop machine went down, I had to come back into the office to restart it
john while I was on call
john I hated life
john no guarantees there
john http://paste:8080/paste?c=l7210
john the second stanza is really the only one I use
john change jconnolly-dev to aturley-dev if that's what you named your desktop machine, naturally
john then, similar to your work setup, ssh -N sshgw-varick &!
john ssh localhost -p 7002
john and if you want vnc, just x11vnc &! on your work machine, then point your favorite vnc client to localhost:7003
john if ssh -N sshgw-varick pukes on you, lmk and we have to talk to doug
john alright it might be another one-off then
john try dev/ladders
john for user/pass
john I forgot we share an account on this shitbox
john nice
john no prob
john take a look around at 'device list', and the perf tab for platform service nodes
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: lunch plans?
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: wanna go over getting a local vagrant instance of a service going?
john we're using rabbitmq for background processing type stuff
john sometimes it hiccups or consumers don't consume everything the producer is producing because it goes offline
john that management interface will help you figure out who is being a little brat, so you can bring it back online
john oooone sec
john wait til you see what a clusterfuck getting to webui's for prod/staging is
john http://paste:8080/paste?c=oid76
john set network.proxy.socks_remote_dns to true
john same for http://uslw14:8080/status ?
john http://membase2.idc.theladders.com/
john that node might be under heavy use
john try membase1
john also sshs membase1
john the webui password is in the motd
john Administrator / 9gy1LU1r

john yeah happily
john fuckin underscores
john http://bit.ly/OX4hxq
john riak is pretty fucking close to hypermedia
john see my bitly link
john those are my thoughts
john i think the concern is sunk cost in clusterix, and migrating to a new database would be costly, even if it did give us hypermedia
john I think sean is JVM bound, and clusterix-compatible bound for any architectural decision he can make
john oh totally
john yeah definitely
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley and john
john btw when I saw the "peter's more successful mirror image"...
john I thought you were talking about indian peter
john I guess that means I'm healing?
john he's good shit, he was at restfest too
john his skin is in the game, he's an entrepreneur that built his own business, this isn't just academic to him
john 17:44 < pezra> and i really don't think that most business are really that different from each  other on the ecommerce side of things

jconnolly configured to use qa ldap
jconnolly no, I don't think I can do that.
jconnolly I have the same privileges here that I'd have on a qa box
jconnolly I hadn't tried that one.  just vagrant up and vagrant destroy
jconnolly vagrant ssh was pretty useless
tk1 can you code PD?????
tk1 yayaaaay
tk1 max too?
tk1 aw. so you're a purist

jconnolly Not sure if I'm going to get reimbursed for it, but it should be good
jconnolly ah he did?
jconnolly nice
jconnolly ah right
jconnolly his anniversary weekend

jconnolly DO NOT USE CAPITALS.
jconnolly no
jconnolly $19.47 on amazon prime... worth buying?
jconnolly people were going through SICP at hacker school
jconnolly I should've done a bit of that
jconnolly yeah
jones not really 	  				 	 	 	   	 	  	   		  	 
jones just apply the right manifest for the app and you should get jdk 7 	  				 	 	 	   	 	  	   		  	 
jones experimenting with jdk7 on an app not already using it
jones would require the superuser fix
jones there is no easy way to look this up i'm afraid
jones the list of jetty things is in mercurial:/repos/puppet/jetty/manifests/init.pp
jones but the list of which manifests get applied to what are stored elsewhere
jones so i'll have to go get it for you
jones hmm
jones seems it's just jetty::platform
jones right
jones jetty::platform will use jdk 7 
jones and 512m Xmx w/ 256m permgen
jones seems like a strange setting 
jones that's odd
jones vagrant destroy, vagrant up, see if it happens again
jones i just fixed that a moment ago
jones nope
jones it will cache the thing
jones yep
jones you know what
jones the manifest is broken/wrong
jconnolly heh whatever, I enjoy trolling the pedantic much more
jones manifest fixed
jones something was not parameterized that shoulda been
jones jdk version was getting set in a variable
jones so it wasn't getting closed around inside the top level puppet clas
jconnolly wtf

jconnolly I think it's just BDD
jconnolly and the company doing it is an agile enthusiast
jconnolly hehe yeah
jconnolly think I'm gonna postpone the ireland trip
jconnolly spring or summer next year
jconnolly because I'm paying off a $5k amex bill this month, and we'd be going to ireland with very little cash in the bank, on just credit, with no accomodations but a rental car booked
jconnolly seems irresponsible 
jconnolly sacha's also uneasy about her mom and leaving the puppy with my mom for 10 days
jconnolly and also about finances
jconnolly soooooo..
jconnolly I have to eat the $600 'cancel for any time' insurance fee, and get a credit for use with bmit.com any time within a year
jconnolly 'cancel for any reason'
jconnolly yeah...
jconnolly anything around travel, I get the damned cancel insurance
jconnolly I just miss the comfort of having 5 figures in the bank
jconnolly you get this too?
jconnolly http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-testing/agile-testing-and-bdd-exchange-nyc
jconnolly yowzer that one was $500
jconnolly yeah
jconnolly me too
jconnolly nice thanks man!
jconnolly this gives me some time to buff up before absorb before attending a conference on it

jconnolly http://marriagesmusic.bandcamp.com/
jconnolly part the dark again is good
jconnolly but the album seems to be pretty good in general
jconnolly kinda dark in a 90's kind of dark way
jconnolly part the dark again is the best song I've heard on the album yet
jconnolly ;D
jconnolly haven't seen it, I'll look it over
jconnolly this is the same kind of direct/immediate manipulation thing?
jconnolly deh
jconnolly it's an old problem
jconnolly I remember a quote from college that was something like 'the problem with [man pages, textbooks, insert documentation here] is that only people who know how to use [program, language, etc] understand it."
jconnolly BUT YOU MUST ANNOTATE THE PARAMETERS TOO
jconnolly BECAUSE HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT THE THIRD PARAMETER IS RADIUS?!
jconnolly HOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?!
jconnolly yeah
jconnolly we did the bank kata for being a cleander coder
jconnolly wrapping primitives is nice
jconnolly that one became immediately obvious
jconnolly whenever I see more than... 5 params to a constructor, I think "you probably need a builder for this fucker"
jconnolly You can call methods on classes too, which is how you create objects. In the example below, we call the string method on the NSString class, which returns a new NSString object: 
jconnolly id myObject = [NSString string];
jconnolly http://i.imgur.com/UmpOi.gif
jconnolly eek the headers look awful though
jconnolly -(BOOL)writeToFile:(NSString *)path atomically:(BOOL)useAuxiliaryFile;
jconnolly maybe it's just my java brain sploding at the pointers
jconnolly hehe
jconnolly wat
jconnolly that's not readable 
jconnolly just got to brett victor's learnable programming on hn
jconnolly every time i walk around my neighborhood I wonder

jconnolly <cursor blinky>
jconnolly hah, chrome wins the race!
jconnolly okay, this must've been written by someone on the east coast
jconnolly As I stood there looking at it, I noticed something I'd never seen before: the East Coast and the West Coast of the US are very different... Yes, I know they're very different culturally (LA vs. NY; TMZ vs. NPR; etc.).
jconnolly or I hate the west coast even more

#theladders < jconnolly> aturley: you ready to pair brogram bro?
sean ha
sean did you get a pay slip?
sean from whom?
sean the rest were on mine
sean i wonder
#fighting_narwhals < sean> aturley can explain better than i
sean when are you away?
sean do you get the consumer scrum emails?
sean i
sean i'm going to have you added so you have more insight into what they are doing
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: make a note of that ^^
#fighting_narwhals < kwinter> aturley/sean: do we know if it's prepending or appending new data by any chance?
andrewjones *examines tie knot in mirror* "well at least this way i didn't have to clean the blood out of my *good* suit"
#fighting_narwhals < sean> aturley talked
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley
sean we just laid off il sun btw, in case you didnt notice him leaving
sean just now
sean about 10 minutes ago
sean no
sean this was entirely performance related
sean he had been able to hide out on CRM team not doing anyhting
sean and no one was paying attention to CRM
sean he came over the enterprise and every was paying attention
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: okay, I'm sufficiently angry that I'm attempting to make bad decisions just to verify I know what I know
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley is away today
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: you didn't have to chime in that it's yours
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: everyone needs your number anyway, that's kinda part of being on call
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley 
jconnolly nice
jconnolly thanks for the heads up
#theladders < johnkpaul> aturley == turntable
jconnolly how're you doing?
jconnolly sean has you on fabric?
jconnolly what'd you guys use for deployment at octopart?
jconnolly ah
jconnolly I argued to use puppet
jconnolly but apparently dgrove is swamped and hated the "puppet for java developers" implementation discussed in that presentation of the same name
jconnolly http://java.dzone.com/articles/puppet-java-developers
jconnolly https://github.com/carlossg/puppet-for-java-devs
jconnolly we had a meeting about onboarding curriculum 
jconnolly you might be our guinea pig
jconnolly nothing crazy, just going through a kata we're writing up, going through SOLID, pairing with someone for two weeks.  then we mine you for thoughts to apply to people we're hiring
jconnolly then there's 'apprenticeship' where you're on a team and you get assigned another mentor or whatever term we're going to use for it... someone you can ask the stupidest of questions without fear of reprimand, someone who will be responsible for showing you the ropes, team-specific-goals etc
jconnolly but I think you won't be doing that.  at least in the near term.  who knows though
jconnolly we'll both be doing that, basically, soon
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley is official
jconnolly hooboi
c4milo acm I think 
c4milo yeah 
c4milo let me forward his email 
sean ummmmmm

sean and either your prod or qa password
sean dunno which as my prod and qa password are the same
sean i think qa
mrbeefy I think kat went to that
b9punk skippy!
b9punk that's his name :)
b9punk it will happen
b9punk some easter egg somewhere

jconnolly you can have a vineyard in it, because it's got its own microclimate
jconnolly all you need is for trep-search and tungsten1
jconnolly and do it in one jira

#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: how do they fail?
tk1 have you built anything for kinect up until now?
tk1 okay
tk1 selfishly i'd like to leverage the thought capital around me.
tk1 if you know what i mean:)
tk1 i saw this and fell in love with it.
tk1 http://www.aaronkoblin.com/Aaronetrope/
tk1 probably not an elementary initial project though:)
tk1 http://www.aaronkoblin.com/Aaronetrope/
tk1 Yup. Brains. 
tk1 Its like a cerebral fortress up here!
tk1 what?
tk1 do you know his name?
tk1 right...
tk1 why could i access and not you?
tk1 hmmmm
tk1 of course.
tk1 i see.
tk1 in what contexts did his name appear?
tk1 and no luck?
tk1 i see. 
tk1 perhaps he's over enveloped in self.
tk1 so, you were supposed to keep your thoughts to yourself
tk1 hmm. sound tyranical
tk1 can i ask where you were working?
tk1 oh i see.
tk1 did you work the site?
tk1 or program for the products?
tk1 WOW
tk1 and now you are at the ladders?
tk1 ;)
tk1 hmmm. okay. its lovely enough i suppose.
tk1 so the kinect
tk1 (admitting ignorance)
tk1 open frameworks?
tk1 c++
tk1 what is it you use for it exactly?
tk1 or perhaps it depends.
tk1 (admitting more ignorance)
tk1 so openframe works isn't just for 3D objects etc?
tk1 okay
tk1 for some reason my brain is making a Maya connection.
tk1 cool.
tk1 :D
tk1 ugh. todd wants me to write a blog post on the OHS.
tk1 ugh.
tk1 anyway
tk1 we'll have to think of a kinect idea.
tk1 if we could incorporate video in some way that would be excellent. i do some video installations. 
tk1 sweet. no rush...its not like i have a show lined up or anything (though i'm trying)
tk1 ANYWAY this would be a ladders connected project!:D
tk1 software wise?
tk1 well
tk1 final cut.
tk1 but i'm trying to dig through after effects right now.
tk1 hmm
tk1 nope
tk1 not sure what that is even.
tk1 ya
tk1 i tried to use max + quick time files + arduino to do an interactive video installation.
tk1 but i was too green at it all and overly ambitious. unfortunately it was a bit of a bust
tk1 in the end people just liked the video while i was stressing about getting the motion sensor to work right.
tk1 hahaha i know
tk1 its a fine line!
tk1 interactivity
tk1 it can't be so minimal people don't really notice
tk1 or too complex so people don't get overwhelmed.
tk1 and in the end
tk1 people are just accustomed to passive 
tk1 to BEING passive while watching moving images, like video
tk1 anyway its still worth trying. like with this toblin character...the video isn't standard. but of course not in a physical space.
tk1 sure. no rush.  was feeling inspired today.
tk1 ya. mondays are good.
tk1 yay!
john hehe
john I like hardware too much to be pair brogramming with some bros

john weird
john you need to sleep both before and after?

john yeah I was in the elevator with Patty Youngklaus and she had no idea what chartbeat was or that we were using it
john she was saying how we were formally announcing the freeness of our recruit-side of our site
john I said "oh interesting.  well for consumer-side we have chartbeat so you can see this-over-last-week total concurrent visitors.  Wonder if they have it for recruiter side."
john she was like "we should have a friday forum about what's on the walls!  I had no idea!"

john discover student loans just bought my citigroup student loans
john first they bought them, then to resolve that fact with the credit agencies, they said that my loans with citigroup are in a "CONTESTED" status, which is bad if you're say, applying for a mortgage
john then I try to log into the discovery student loan web portal to set up autopay
john Loans Serviced by Discover (as of 10/19/2012)
john The system is currently under maintenance and will be available in a few hours. If you need to make a payment or check your account status, please call us at 1-800-550-0904.

b9punk hahaha
b9punk word
b9punk hey, btw
b9punk the project that i'm working on with wayne etc... i started telling you about it at the meetup
b9punk http://designatomic.info/
b9punk you have to start at the bottom :(
b9punk i should fix that
b9punk ;)
b9punk https://github.com/wawjr3d/atomic
b9punk it's coming along
b9punk there's some stuff that's really hard though :(
b9punk haven't quite figured out how to get stuff or out of the library
Drew hey
Drew u still working on scripts?
Drew ok
Drew just checking
Drew so I can update a spreadsheet
john GA is retarded
john they're like the ITP of that universe
john not sure if pyramid scheme, fraud, stupidity, honeypot, joke or University of Phoenix outpost...
john haha exactly
#theladders < kathleen> aturley: no, I don't have that one.
john genius: http://codereddit.com/
john it should be the front page, yeah
Drew do you guys have a standup?
Drew ok
Drew so feel free to ping me when you have questions
Drew also. let me know if you've committed any code for tracking
Drew since I'm acting as the product owner proxy
john hm good question
john not really.  I mean one thing I'd like maybe is there to be verbose vs. "quiet" output.  just tell me the current state of the release but i don't need to see stdout from scp, etc.  
john It's noisy and more difficult to spot potential issues.
john --verbose would give me all that stdout
john and maybe http://nezzen.net/2008/06/23/colored-text-in-python-using-ansi-escape-sequences/
john ?
tk1 yup
tk1 i am 
tk1 are you still planning to go?
john if log.error(sys.stderr.write("\033"+color[red]+)...
tk1 looks like john and gergen are as well.
john log.info white, etc
john is that too diva to ask for?
tk1 maybe we all trek together
john haha
tk1 free drinks at 6:30, right?
tk1 sounds good.
tk1 one of my old bosses/friends from chicago razorfish is in town...and she'll meet us too
tk1 oo
tk1 was it interesting/worthwhile?
tk1 this is my first
john and a gui
john in swing
john kthx
tk1 oooooo
tk1 you know what else is like that.
tk1 is those f-ing digital dumbo events
tk1 those are awful. have you been?

john this gui

b9punk the pictures were horrifying - but not a good internet horrifying
tk1 ya. you can pass on the digital dumbo events i think...ya
b9punk never go full meme
john haha.
tk1 dumbo, hipster attitude consumes them i think
john I remember burning out our dot matric printer with the paintings I'd make.
b9punk going to ignite?
john my dad got so fucking pissed
b9punk yay
b9punk many of my peeps from $lastjob will be there

b9punk been exploring the last few months, and it's been lovely
tk1 how long have you been here?
b9punk 20 min
b9punk i have the C on the corner though
b9punk but the C... actually sucks :)
b9punk it's really wacky
b9punk sometimes the trains get bunched up
b9punk and then there aren't any for like 25 min randomly at peak hours
b9punk but i'm also like 3 blocks from the atlantic center.. so... all the trains
john is that tonight?

b9punk i wish i could get up early enough to consider things liek that
b9punk are you a runner? i just commited to a 5k with a friend, but i don't know what i'm doing :)

Drew hi
Drew i don't think so
Drew this is for sage
Drew our old CMS
Drew which we try to avoid
Drew I'm not sure there is a page on it
Drew but the deployment scripts for prod
Drew the creative deployment scripts that is
Drew shoudl cover it
Drew if sean doesn't know how to do it
Drew maybe christina does
Drew though I still think we should explore deplying to versioned directories
john it looked highly crashable
john hehe
#migration < cfield> aturley, tough laptop though, these days except for macs the laptops seem much more fragile
#migration < jones> aturley: ok have fun in gnu screen i guess
#migration < jones> aturley: or you could install windows and watch it *fly*
#migration < cfield> aturley, no autoexec menu
#migration < jones> aturley: it doens't really matter
#migration < jones> aturley: motif and emacs on your linux box isn't magically more efficient than irix/solaris/whatever
tk1 hey! srry just mentally dialing in now
tk1 hmmmmmmm i like it....
tk1 ya
tk1 there's quite a few ways we could take this
tk1 and let's face it...in terms of 'collaboration'
tk1 everyone seems to love skippy

john wow
john 14:19:22 ~ history | grep opkg
john  
john > history | grep opkg
john  
john that's both here and at home
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: fwiw, these should disappear again
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley- i blame you for how badly this lack of spaces works out
john how're you doing over there?
john I just starting poking into this tracking idea.  I was under the assumption that when Drew said we had a session and visitor_tracking_id in place already, he meant in the new lw.
john there is no such mechanism =/
john I have to build that first, then track it.
john motherfucker
john they didn't distinguish between what was in place in old lw and new
john and they're deathly afraid of polluting new code with old
john while referencing features "oh hey that just exists already"... in old lw
john heh, that's why I started there.
john actually I started looking at if something like this exists for jetty already.
john then I thought hm maybe I should do it on the service-client side.
john then thought "alright lets see code gathering this information already"
john shocker.. there is none
john yep
john braceletsnapsecs
john only to find that there's no electric
john but the team is ready to seal the walls
john so fucking hurry up!  or you'll be snaking those damned cables through the rebar!
john haha
john if it's any consolation, I was on my way back from LI this weekend waiting for a train, got a slice of pizza.  I hear the guy behind the counter being all "What firm do you work for?  Oh I was with <TLA>!  Yeah, sure, I know Al.  You still doing residential or picking up commercial."
john poor architect was serving pizza
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: that's passed in from all platform services' parent pom, platform-java-service/pom.xml, which defines those properties as localhost and 8082
tk1 indeed. well at least just the murderous ones.:)
john really?  they never did it?
john I thought we went through it last week but now I'm remembering that was something else entirely
john well
john for when they do
john add this to your ssh config:
john   LocalForward 9306 trep-search.idc.theladders.com:22
john   LocalForward 9307 tungsten1.idc.theladders.com:22
john under DynamicForward localhost:12002
john well
john if you havet his:
john Host *.idc.theladders.com
john     User jconnoll
john     ProxyCommand /bin/nc -x localhost:12002 %h %p
john if yours is
john Host *.frontend.idc.theladders.com, make the localforwards trep-search.frontend.idc.theladders.com
john or, fix them all to be .idc instead of frontend.idc, either way, they have to be consistent
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: heh.  i was starting on the yesterday afternoon, but something shinny came by and i was all http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrAIGLkSMls&t=0m7s and then forgot 
#migration < jones> aturley: btw i was actually hoping the schoduler would be hung up, but no it issues (harmless) exceptions on a regular basis
#migration < jones> aturley: yep.  imagine JSP, but written by/for RPG/COBOL guys 
john sudo -l
john will tell you what you can do as sudo
john do you see /bin/su - rabbitmq?
john depending on who does it, dgrove or jones that can change
john here's mine
john eh this was easier before Tuc left
john     (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/su rabbitmq
john     (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/su tomcat
john     (tomcat) NOPASSWD: ALL
john     (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/su ladders
john     (ladders) NOPASSWD: ALL
john yip
dgrove eh
dgrove does it work on 2?
dgrove at least you know about sudo -l
dgrove your in the 1% of devs
dgrove this config is dumb
dgrove how many rabbitmq nodes are there?
dgrove oh god
dgrove this is so fucking stupid
dgrove someone halfassed this
dgrove sudoers_RABBITMQ is a ldap group
dgrove with the right people in it
dgrove yet on the server, there's a local useralias that it uses
dgrove wtf people?
dgrove damn skippy 
dgrove try rabbitmq1 now
dgrove ...and 2 now
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: you set?
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: and done on tungston too
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley, john- i just have some tests and code cleanup left on redirect shuffle stuff
john whaye?
john ah that kind of shit
john get home and get rest
john I've slept like 6 hours in 2 days
john ye olde dry-out
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley, john: how are you doing? any roadblocks? issues?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: how are we doing against projected milestones for release scripts?
jconnolly Shell(command).execute ?
sean you will need to know this eventually for building war to release new lw:
sean  warman11985 or christina, what steps do I need to go through to resolve GET http://localhost:8080/css/theladders.css 404 (Not Found) 
sean <jconnolly> tell me and I'll document it so you won't be bugged again ;D
sean <kwinter> check out fighting-narwhals-webapp and thirdparty-static-dependencies (all at the same level), and run mvn compile on webapp
sean <jconnolly> beautiful thanks kwinter 
jconnolly hmmmmmmm greeeasssyyy
jconnolly I'm leaving early today to go to a wake so I'll likely be bringing lunch back to try to make some headway
jconnolly it sounds distant, but my cousin stephen's grandfather on his mother's side
jconnolly we always did christmas/easter/thanksgiving/birthdays etc with them
jconnolly guy was a pistol
#fighting_narwhals < sean> aturley, jconnolly
jconnolly depends
jconnolly my jobseeker ID is 7881189
jconnolly in QA
jconnolly here's one from prod:
jconnolly 9212758
jconnolly 7 digits I guess?
jconnolly I don't know if that's a valid assumption though.
jconnolly http://www.411mania.com/movies/news/260282/[VIDEO]-Stephen-Colbert-Offers-Donald-Trump-One-Million-Dollars-If-He-Can-Teabag-Him.htm
jconnolly ah shit it's 4:00
jconnolly gotta jet
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley talks over there in #fighting_narwhals
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: how goes it?
jconnolly he's WFH
jconnolly so sean can get away with it
jconnolly and so can sean
jconnolly save the overt aggression for WFH days.  use the passive aggression always.
jconnolly on the plus side
jconnolly I've got the basics of BI reporting working
jconnolly https://gist.github.com/fdd4036130df1f749acb
jconnolly that's triggere for any request against <host>/api/*, creates a ServiceRequestEvent object, puts it on a queue, after some condition is met (queue is > 10 items), it iterates over the events and calls event.reportWith(DaoReporter) or whatever other reporting item I want
jconnolly taking that SOLID shit to the heart, sen
jconnolly eh there's going to be much more hateful magic
jconnolly for example, the requests' entity can't be cast to a JSONObject for inspection if it's a GET request, because the Entity is empty and JSONObject does NOT like you fucking with empties.
jconnolly but if it DOES have a body that's JSON, I need to translate to XML before writing it to the dao
jconnolly lots of le conditionals
jconnolly http://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2012/10/williamsburg_brooklyn_to_sunnyside_queens_getting_reacquainted_with_a_rejuvenated_neigh
#team-chaos-monkey < daniel> aturley, jconnolly, and sean, see CR-ARCH-20
jconnolly it's complete bullshit
jconnolly you have to access through a browser
jconnolly and it proxies everything through an in-browser vpn plugin
jconnolly or something incredibly unbelievably awful like that
jconnolly I tried it out
jconnolly it is NOT what we had at bug with openvpn
jconnolly yeah
jconnolly well
jconnolly some of them you can actually access
jconnolly like...
jconnolly http://confluence.laddersoffice.com
jconnolly you don't get redirected?
jconnolly i get redirected to https://portalauth.laddersoffice.com/vpn/tmindex.html
jconnolly when I hit http://confluence.laddersoffice.com from home
jconnolly weird
jconnolly are you on chrome... via ssh -X?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley isnt answering about lunch because he is working. damn him.
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: what the hell did you link?
jconnolly yes
jconnolly I've got a little monkeywork to do this morning, then that
jconnolly then if you're ready for a quick break
jconnolly you and I power through getting this BI shit into a db, and you give me some feedback as to how it works
jconnolly it needs eyes
jconnolly cool
jconnolly um, how about job-application-service ?
#theladders < johnkpaul> aturley: I see your point in general, the less we have to undersatnd, the more prone we are to writing unclean not-readable code
#theladders < johnkpaul> aturley: I actually read that link, it's pretty cray to expect that an IDE needs to be designed _before_ the language
#theladders < johnkpaul> aturley: I don't think that it's in order to understand, I think it's to aid understaning
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: sorry ended up in the weeds a little this afternoon.  I'm trying to push my BI tracking changes to narwhals but I want to make sure I'm not going to screw up their tests, and it appears I am at the moment.  intercepting a resume upload request is bad news.
jconnolly I can't think right today.
jconnolly     if(!(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.equals(request.getMediaType()))){
jconnolly       return request;
jconnolly     }
jconnolly there is one exception to that that I'm trying to incorporate.
jconnolly if (request.getMediaType() == null) && request.getMethod().equals(RequestMethod.GET), then I don't want that to return request.
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: http://www.fpaste.org/1Bsv/
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley
jconnolly yes
jconnolly ssh://mercurial//repos/service-status maybe
jconnolly hehe
jconnolly all of those are broken I think
jconnolly hostnames are wrong etc
jconnolly apparently there is a dashboard
jconnolly web/index.html
jconnolly indeed
jconnolly it's a good idea
jconnolly that seemed to receive too little attention
jconnolly just fucking spend a week on it and finish it!
jconnolly I actually didn't know that existed until...
jconnolly 10/16
jconnolly peter mentioned it in #fighting_narwhals
jconnolly 6189 16:20 < warman11985> sean services down?
jconnolly 6190 16:21 < sean> what services?
jconnolly 6191 16:22 < john> I'm going to write a script.
jconnolly 6192 16:22 < john> that just curls status on all platform services.
jconnolly 6193 16:22 < john> and cowsays whether something is up or down.                                                                                                                                                                         
jconnolly 6194 16:24 < sean> hehe
jconnolly 6195 16:24 < warman11985> good idea
jconnolly 6196 16:25 < sean> kwinter... how does member-servlet and login-servlet map to classes?
jconnolly 6197 16:26 < peter> john: hg clone ssh://mercurial//repos/service-status
#fighting_narwhals < kwinter> aturley- pull and update
#migration < jones> aturley: wget -O - http://www.c64web.com
jconnolly yo
jconnolly uslw1.idc.theladders.com
jconnolly NO DASHES FOR YOU
jconnolly it's not in prod yet, so there are qa machines
jconnolly I think there may be a staging machine too
jconnolly ask in #fighting_narwhals
jconnolly np
#fighting_narwhals < kwinter> aturley: going on 11 days
jconnolly fwiw
jconnolly 17:00 < jconnolly> what does JSSC stand for/
jconnolly 17:02 < gundel> jconnolly: job search support center
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: ok, in that case i'll do the puppet bits then
jconnolly actually
jconnolly it just reminded me to email al and grundy again
jconnolly because Al used to spend an hour every morning at Bug chatting with anyone who would listen about the virtues of ZFS
jconnolly to the point where people had to eventually cut him off and plead with him to let them get to work
jconnolly he just started down this facebook path as fb was getting all that flack for having such a shittily rated app for iOS because "it made engineering sense for it to be a webapp"
jconnolly err
jconnolly he just started down this iOS path as fb was getting all that flack for having such a shittily rated app for iOS because "it made engineering sense for it to be a webapp"
jconnolly so it MUST BE NATIVE.
jconnolly yeah, it seems like a startup antipattern
jconnolly PERFORMANT FIRST
jconnolly hg pull haha what'd you google
jconnolly yikes
jconnolly oh what a vision
jconnolly was that actually what you saw?
jconnolly I found myself in the deja vus inducing position asking my wife if she'd seen tubgirl ever
jconnolly last night
jconnolly "YES.  STAHP."
jconnolly ohhh fancy
jconnolly oh shit that is a dump
tk1 hi!
tk1 yes, i was thinking of this this weekend
tk1 that i hadn't heard any progress reports from you.
tk1 :P
tk1 S M A R T goals?
tk1 apologies  -- was this brought up in the presentation on Friday?
tk1 if so, i had tuned out before even the 5 minute mark.
tk1 Well, let's have some afternoon time in the next couple days and talk about it.?
tk1 :)
tk1 ohhh.
tk1 NO
tk1 perhaps its the first installment of the 'LaddersLab'
tk1 the burgeoning, developing think that of tech amazingness.
tk1 :D
tk1 sure.  why not!
tk1 has a nice ring to it.
tk1 as they do.
tk1 often they get distracted with other priorities
tk1 thus the tragedy of the creative services realm.
tk1 Its true
tk1 And then I think we infect ourselves with grandiousity
tk1 we pull in words like 'ecosystem' etc
tk1 to make our positions seem more than they really are.
tk1 or make our roles and practice more than what it is.
tk1 but, at least it pushes us to get smarter.
tk1 true.
tk1 cool.
tk1 man this stuff
tk1 its like greek to me!
tk1 oi.
tk1 i need you guys' help !!!
tk1  oi.
mattjanks Checking…  One sec.
mattjanks I thought it was laddersoffice.com
mattjanks port 5672
mattjanks Looking at our configuration file though, looks like we are hitting a LB and not a particular machine.
mattjanks Doesn't really help you though.
mattjanks Okay, nice.
mattjanks No worries.  I don't think many here have much experience troubleshooting RabbitMq.
mattjanks So if you need me to help out at all, I'd be glad to.
mattjanks Heh.
mattjanks Were you able to find a runbook on Confluence?
mattjanks I was looking at the web admin to see the # of messages.
mattjanks http://ent-rmq-qa-1:55672/#/
mattjanks Shit, um...
mattjanks Try guest/guest?
mattjanks Yeah, I guess so.  Anything in the logs point to something suspicious?
mattjanks We noticed errors in our Storm topologies on 11/09.
mattjanks I think restarting is fine.
mattjanks Hah.
mattjanks Yeah, I guess I wouldn't spend too much of your time figuring out what went wrong.  As long as we have the logs, we can ping Sean later on.
mattjanks I don't want this to become a time vampire for you.
mattjanks Cool.
mattjanks Weird.
mattjanks Do you know the password for the rabbitmq user on that machine?
mattjanks I was attempting to hop on as well and at least take a look at it.
mattjanks Nice.  Still a strange set of circumstances though.
mattjanks Interesting.  I'd give it a few minutes.
mattjanks See what happens.
mattjanks Oh that's interesting.
mattjanks Hm.
jconnolly I think it depends on what the problem is =/
jconnolly I almost always punt on rabbitmq issues
jconnolly guh I can't remember the login for the basicauth on the admin console
jconnolly yeah
jconnolly hm
jconnolly not the staging one or prod
jconnolly and
jconnolly that's "ent-rmq-qa-2"
jconnolly that's enterprise...
jconnolly I'd probably punt to them
jconnolly or ask sean 
jconnolly alright
jconnolly I think sean had a rant that we're not "platform" we're API-services
jconnolly namely because tungsten and rabbitmq got dumped on us
mattjanks K, let me fire up a local storm topology here that picks off messages.
mattjanks Oh yeah, it's working its ass off right now.
mattjanks 184 messages/sec on rabbitmq
mattjanks 196
mattjanks 619
mattjanks haha
mattjanks Nice work.
mattjanks Thanks for all your help.
mattjanks I felt bad putting it on you guys.  If it involves Storm, I'm always happy to help out.
mattjanks That's right.
mattjanks Wonder if some other things need to be restarted.  There are some large queues that aren't being consumed it looks like.
mattjanks Anyways, not a RabbitMQ issue.
mattjanks Just interesting data.
#fighting_narwhals < peter> aturley: what was wrong with rabbitmq in QA? looks like there are a lot of messages on history consumer queues… was history consumer dead in QA?
#fighting_narwhals < peter> aturley and jconnolly - next time there's a rabbitmq issue, feel free to grab me if anything seems mysterious
#fighting_narwhals < peter> aturley / jconnolly - i'd say history consumer is dead in qa by looking at messages piling up on rabbitmq
jconnolly want to just roll all the jobseeker and job nodes?
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: thoughts on this...
jconnolly she's alright.  Sacha drove her back to Long Island so she could see her doctor
jconnolly my brother is with her now so she's in good hands.
jconnolly I'm hoping I don't hear bad news.
jconnolly her getting pregos kept the big D-word off the table for a few weeks
jconnolly so it'd be pretty catastrophic for my brother if this ends up being very bad
jconnolly and of course jackie
jconnolly anyway, thanks for asking
jconnolly my mom got power back today.  
jconnolly wonder if it's because I emailed the CEO last night.
jconnolly CEO of LIPA
jconnolly firstinitialLastname@lipower.org worked ;D
jconnolly I got a reply.
jconnolly He said she's reportedly scheduled for this morning.  She got power back this afternoon.
jconnolly fortunately no boom ;D
jconnolly basement breaker is still off until the mechanics can get to it.
jconnolly vpn is going to be a gamechanger
jconnolly I can actually get some shit done without wanting to smash my computer.
jconnolly hehe
jconnolly I just like being able to casually check on something as it occurs to me
jconnolly "oh this queue should be processing DB request events asynchronously.  it'd be cool to see how old lw did that..."
jconnolly when I started at bug I knew how wet behind the ears I was
jconnolly I spent most of my nights reading code just to get to the level of my coworkers
jconnolly I went through wikis and documented how to compile the kernel, how to get a webcam to work etc...  it was so damned helpful
jconnolly yeah.  and I prefer to spend my own time learning if I feel an order of magnitude less competent than my peers.
jconnolly lol
jconnolly 17:42 <jconnolly> http://buglabs.net
jconnolly 17:43 <jones> hahahahaha open source hardware

jconnolly 17:43 <jconnolly> yes
jconnolly 17:43 <jconnolly> yes
jconnolly 17:43 <jones> the macarena plays in their office in a loop
jconnolly I forgot to mention yesterday too
jconnolly (11:22:23 AM) Peter Semmelhack: Hey John - pinging you here because I'm not sure if you still check your bug email.
jconnolly (11:23:54 AM) Peter Semmelhack: #1 - we closed our financing(!)  So that long, hard road is now over
jconnolly (11:25:24 AM) Peter Semmelhack: #2 - I need to get our web assets all sorted ASAP.  Our community web site comments is a mess.  I seem to recall you knowing something about it.  Is that true?  Is there some easy way for us to just dump it all?
jconnolly (from Sunday morning)
jconnolly yeaaaahhh
jconnolly I started typing a reply yesterday
jconnolly then just gave up
jconnolly I couuulld charge him like $500 to remove and scrub our community site from existence.
jconnolly terg probably told him "uhhh, I think john knows something about that."
jconnolly hehe yes.
jconnolly that.
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: no wonder you got hired, you talked to kyri about RC cars
jconnolly http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/support/bg_images/bgimagess09-10.jpg
jconnolly now you get the full context.
jconnolly "oh it's treefoot!"
jconnolly "i should've known"
jconnolly heh
jconnolly haha.

jconnolly googling NYU hoax might be a new pasttime for me.
jconnolly I kinda want this for some reason.
jconnolly http://sellout.woot.com/
jconnolly oh that's why I want it.
jconnolly hehe
b9punk hey thanks :)
b9punk how goes? what did i miss?
b9punk aha! i suspected
b9punk i think i've heard that talk before
b9punk did he make anyone quit this time?
b9punk what were the bubbles in the diagram
b9punk colorado was cold and predictible
b9punk had to babysit my mother
b9punk she had an ankle surgery
b9punk hehe
b9punk word
b9punk a hoot
b9punk she basically wouldn't accept any help
b9punk it was a guilt trip of futility
b9punk i guess they usually are
b9punk happy to be back
b9punk hoping for some nicer weather
b9punk got some in CO.. it was soooo cold
b9punk oh i wish
b9punk crazy girl diet
b9punk saw your tweet :) they look good
b9punk bliss!
jconnolly maybe drinkipoos tomorrow?
jconnolly going to a hackerschool alumni thing at fatcat at 8pm tomorrow too
jconnolly I just feel like going to sleep.
jconnolly ah
jconnolly alrighty
jconnolly I'm ducking out.
mattjanks http://paste:8080/paste?c=f4qpo
jconnolly hey did you ever have your 90-day?
cfield brain computer interface for emacs would be way cooler
jconnolly ah when did you start again?
jconnolly I think there was an old email chain saying you'd start 8/15 that I was going by
jconnolly have you been able to ssh into the rabbitmq lb?
jconnolly I'm trying to go through this in prod, just log in etc
jconnolly https://confluence.laddersoffice.com/display/TECH/RabbitMQ+-+Runbook
#theladders < johnkpaul> aturley: yeah, but less parens
#theladders < johnkpaul> aturley: I think that the difference isn't solely the charcters
jconnolly oh yeah?
jconnolly Was wondering wheb that was going to happen.
jconnolly feeling meh.  shit immune system this winter, or there are super rhinoviruses about.
jconnolly i just needed sleep.  fucking puppy is getting up earlier and earlier each day
jconnolly exactly
jconnolly heh.  Actually I hadn't thought of it.
jconnolly good idea.  all yours though, i got a bonus for your hire.
jconnolly hiring
jconnolly ha, truth
jconnolly thinking of going to the babel thing?
jconnolly im in
#migration < cfield> aturley: eh?
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: looks like it was a quiet weekend, but maybe I missed something.  anything go bump in the night this weekend?
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: do you get newsletter emails?
jconnolly what the fuck is this class name?
jconnolly AbstractOvalValidationTest
jconnolly ah
jconnolly OVal
jconnolly not Oval

jconnolly grab a drink in a bit?
jconnolly cody's around the corner or do you have somewhere else in mind?
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: are you able to sudo su rabbitmq on those nodes?
jones what's up 	  				 	 	 	    		  	   		  		
jones yeah it's very easy for me to add it
jones it's slightly less easy for you to use it
jones also congratulations on writing build scripts in freaking python
jones thank god it's not shell
jones it's a start
jones i hate shell with the fire of a thousand suns
jones python on centos doesn't enjoy side-by-side installation very much
jones so it gets installed as /usr/bin/python26
jones and sometimes you need to export PYTHON=/usr/bin/python26
jones the end of the world part is that nothing prepackaged will work
jones dealing with any third party library etc will either mean building a custom RPM or hauling it around with you in your own lib directory
jones doing anything with python C bindings, in particular, is gonna have to be a custom RPM
jones so it will be rebuildable later
jones but your base python, that part is easy-peasy
jones and goodness knows base python is capable of a lot
jones perl on centos tends to be a lot easier, not because centos comes with a more modern perl, but because most people are accustomed to being stuck on a perl from the dawn of time
jones so third party libraries tend to work well on the decrepit 5.8.8
jones hence no side-by-side needed
jones right that's not going to work well for you
jones because nothing will be in the standard place
jones and the C portions of the build will fail
jones anything complicated enough to require a setup.py should probably be in an RPM to start with
jones yes virtualenv will help a lot
jones notably you don't have a gcc ... pretty much anywhere
jones and yes pycurl is going to be annoying since it is a c binding.  is urrlib too slow or something
jones centos 5 is starting to show its age argh
jones would love to be on 6 right now
jones use tsocks to wrap the outer script
jones nope
jones i assumed you wanted the proxy for building locally and deploying to qa
jones or something like that
jones something you won't need in a world with vpn
jones yeah.
jones sure
jones yes; it will only take a minute
jones hmm we have a lot more python 26 libraries than i would have thought
jones http://paste:8080/paste?c=nbl5f
jones maybe pycurl won't be bad to add
jones hah
jones i had always thought of fabric as a replacement for e.g. puppet, chef
jones puppet is ill-suited to code deployment, i suppose fabric is as reasonable an adjunct as any
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: when were you planning on taking off time for the holidays?
jones would have been nice to talk about this in concert before code was written
jones but here we are
jones it is fairly normal to find myself on the sharp end of the stick on release engineering
jones welcome to tlc: here's your silo, stay the fuck in there
jones ok so good news
jones it looks like we have most of the dependencies for fabric already
jones yes this is a deeper organisational disease
jones and even if you had known, the outcome would have been the same
jones i'm just carping to carp
jones assuming that we have enough python-knowers in our shop fabric could be a really good-quality basis for code deployment work though
jones might be worth getting it working sooner than later
jones well that is a pity
jones and i would happily troubleshoot that (another day)
jones right now i assume the goal is just o get what you have working asap
jones well I personally will be very unhappy
jones but no, I also would not expect it to work
jones easy_install and pip are not that sharp
jones and we don't keep gcc around
jones and we don't install devel libs
jones and honestly i don't want to replicate an RPM-building node to build source code and 3rd party libs into build scripts... recursive build problem
jones so far this is what i've got
jones   python26::package { [ 'python26-crypto',
jones                         'python26-nose',
jones                         'python26-PyYAML',
jones                         'python26-tools',
jones                         'python26-virtualenv', ]: }
jones I don't know whether setuptools will be there, but if it's not i'm sure it can be packaged relatively quickly
jones notably stuff like paramiko is pure python
jones so it's a matter of an rpm spec that specifies some paths and shit 
jones confusingly
jones jenkins on the local host, the build node
jones devtools on the remote hosts
jones it's a build node
jones oh wait
jones no it's not
jones jenkins-qa-1 is the server
jones the build nodes are either "inf-build..." or "jenkins-build..."
jones oh, do you need paramiko or not?
jones it was ambiugous in prior statement
jones so the puppet manifest is updated but it will take time to roll to all the nodes
jones yes
jones all the build nodes tagged for jenkins anyway
jones jenkins-build-agent-1.shr.laddersoffice.net
jones inf-build-shr-6.shr.laddersoffice.net
jones those are the first two i found that were jenkins-tied
jones yes virtualenv is part of it
jones that was on my list already
jones and yes
jones versioning and managing your weird little tool is important
jones we can build a fabric rpm with some effort
jones i just don't have time to do that TODAY
jones jenkins-build-agent-1 is definitely ready because that is the one i tested with
jones hmmm
jones it did not occur to me that you would need to log in
jones those nodes are typically hands off
jones gonna have to poke around
jones yes it does now that i sit and think about it
jones i forgot to eat lunch today, running low on brain fuel whoops
jones ok so i really don't want to foul up those build nodes
jones right now they're in Real Nice shape
jones how about I add you to that access list
jones and you roll out a vagrant vm patterned after the build node
jones ok the manifest name
jones is buildagent::jenkins
jones you're in the right group to log into jenkins build agents etc
jones please don't use that power for evil or surprising things
jones vagrant-made VMs are real honest to god copies of QA, meaning i don't have any way of unentangling AAA at the moment
jones and it hasn't seemed like it was worth the effort to fix 
jones (yet)
jones can you tell me the ip address of your local desktop here @ 8th ?
jones really
jones hmm
jones it would be /usr/bin/python26 
jones rpm -qa | grep python26
jones (which you can run as a regular user)
jones w-t-f
jones hmmm maybe you logged in before puppet finished its thing
jones python26 + jenkins is a few hundred mb of crap
jones ps -ef | grep puppet maybe
jones well that's just a bag of crap right therej
jones i'm trying it myself now
jones that is all that shuold be required
jones so something is going wrong
jones err: /Stage[main]/Buildagent::Python/Package[python26]/ensure: change from absent to latest failed: Could not update: Execution of '/usr/bin/yum -d 0 -e 0 -y install python26' returned 1: warning: rpmts_HdrFromFdno: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 217521f6
jones that's pretty special, and I'm not sure what causes it
jones never mind i figured it out
jones our repo file is so old it points to an old key
jones on a redhat server that hasn't existed in a few years
jones yeah it's working now
jones please destroy and re-up
jones no dice would need to package it
jones actually no you are in luck
jones epel 5 added it as a midcycle edition
jones dumb luck!
jones interesting
jones fabric itself must be very simple after the mess of dependencies
jones i'm really, really not happy about the thought of manually logging into a box and running "setup.py" on every build node from here to eternity
jconnolly heh yeah
jconnolly I told peter to sniff around the TI omap fallout
jones yes but not really
jones we can have puppet run th escript and check the return code
jones but that doesn't get us very far
jones we then have files spewed onto disk with no checksums etc
jones we also don't know what weird things setup.py is pulling off the wider web
jones no way to verify that one build node is the same as the next
jconnolly exactly
jones so how much is there to your script
jones also
jones assuming your script itself is pure python, this might be as easy as running setup.py inside an RPM spec and collecting the result
jones where is it btw
jones "release-squid" sounds kinda nasty
jones maybe it's just the sibilance
jones oh yeah
jones this is not going to be bad to package.
jones i'm not going to have time to package releasesquid today
jones but python26-pycurl has been uploaded etc
jones if you destroy and re-up you'll have pycurl installed
dgrove this still relevant? (02:40:51 PM) aturley: hey
jconnolly I was thinking the same thing about half way in
jconnolly brb, reboot
dgrove yea, i just read the puppet bits 
dgrove why not just use vagrent? 
jconnolly the very very important database upgrade
jconnolly you don't like the smell?
jconnolly do-ocracy man
jconnolly get in there and put down some kitty litter
jconnolly not even
jconnolly it was kind of a collective groan while kyri put on his wartime face that barely disguised his "I know, I know, forgive me" undertone
jconnolly heh
jconnolly ehhh, I'm just of the attitude "I've been working about as fast and hard as I can (resulting in some sloppiness along the way), I can work 'harder' and 'faster' but the sloppy quotient will go up."
jconnolly also, I'm not staying late more than one night a week.  I can continue working, but it'll be from home.
jconnolly And I better fucking see a bonus.
jconnolly fucking storing ipv4 and ipv6 in mysql as a bigintx2, converting a java string that may be ipv4 or ipv6 into a mysql compatible bigintx2
jconnolly I need to think on that
jconnolly agreed
jconnolly yeah I was just here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#IPv4-mapped_IPv6_addresses
jconnolly this is for reporting/tracking
jconnolly I reaaaaaaaly doubt they're going to dig in an unmap ipv6 to ipv4
jconnolly just store the fucker as a string and walk away
jconnolly got anything going on tonight?
jconnolly want to go to http://bk.knittingfactory.com/event/168575/ ?
jconnolly got an extra ticket
jones ok so what's the status
jones should i be attempting to package fabric, or is fabric truly unnecessary to your script ?
jones (I am indifferent, since the script will have to be packaged regardless, and I expect the specfiles to be similar)
jones no problem
jconnolly my pup has been playing with a lot of pit bulls lately
jconnolly those things are solid balls of pure muscle
jconnolly can you hit http://rabbitmq1web ?
jconnolly yeah
jconnolly snippysnippy
jconnolly so apparently matt peddicord is still at bug
jconnolly but he's the director of operations
jconnolly not the product manager
jconnolly so they need to hire a product manager
jconnolly makes sense
b9punk morning sunshine, how was the beach?
b9punk slept through thanksgiving :)
b9punk had a cold
b9punk the party was okay
b9punk turned kinda geeky at the end
b9punk devolved into youtube around 2
b9punk i like a mix
b9punk too many nerds is smelly and boring
b9punk you missed some fierce punk rock last night
b9punk not from here
b9punk more sean band friends tho
b9punk yesh
b9punk heh
b9punk yes :(
b9punk hahaha
b9punk i'd rather just be anti-social and difficult
b9punk thanks though!
b9punk :)
b9punk i haven't had sugar since march
b9punk your cookies are no match for my willpower
b9punk could be
b9punk heh, me too
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: do you remember the indian buffet antonio and cholly used to be obsessed with?
sean btw, we had a full time 'release engineer' working on scripts to do releases, get to CD etc who worked on it for a year and had another person with him for 6 months
sean you have gotten us further along towards that in a couple weeks than they did in that entire time
sean nicely done
jconnolly wow
jconnolly it's just now sinking in how counterintuitive it is to select "disciplines across functions"
jconnolly and "industries across sector"
jconnolly my natural tendency is to just select one function from the dropdown box and only select the disciplines relevent to me.
jconnolly sprint party!
jconnolly the last buglabs christmas party I worked until 8
jconnolly then got so drunk I threw up in antonio's sink
jconnolly I thought it was, no?
jconnolly was there one after that?
jconnolly ahh i think there was
jconnolly allie orchestrated it, what the hell did we do?
jconnolly ohhh right
jconnolly haha
jconnolly I think I left early
jconnolly before that happened
jconnolly aalright I can't stay late
jconnolly you doing dinner here?
jconnolly saigon shack?
jconnolly is it time?

#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: booting
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley cares about jobseeker-4
#migration < jones> aturley: you're good to go on jobseeker 4 in the LB
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: 4 is done
jconnolly haha no, I don't think so
jconnolly why do you ask?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley- whats up with jobseeker-4? jones going to be able to get routes in today?

#trail-of-tears < sean> aturley fill you in?
jconnolly you going to isaacs' wedding?
jconnolly heh
jconnolly just retweet my tweet
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: needs a BRB
jconnolly how'd your pre-performance-review meeting with sean go this morning?
jconnolly I talked post-sprint
jconnolly he told me to buy an erlang book
jconnolly yeah that's what we discussed briefly.
jconnolly gonna go through here tonight: http://learnyousomeerlang.com/
jconnolly apparently he's coming out with a book
jconnolly http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Some-Erlang-Great-Good/dp/1593274351/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1354293221&sr=8-7&keywords=erlang
jconnolly Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good! is a hilariously illustrated guide
jconnolly hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111kljsdflgkjasfh35a094ieau-9ifg -----,-----
jconnolly all of those other catchy Erlang phrases you'd love to brag to your friends about
jconnolly good tip, thanks mate.
jconnolly as good as this?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfKtXYLG78
jconnolly so how much more is there left to do for release-squid?
jconnolly going to join the be found/be contacted fun soon?
jconnolly this hatch code is truly hideous
jconnolly http://paste:8080/paste?c=fhfg0
jconnolly one method
jconnolly going to work with janks today, welcome to join us
jconnolly basically all of the disciplines across functions code is going to be the same across 5 user stories
jconnolly janks and I are going to do the first two, then the rest we can just hand out and it'll be copying what we did
#fighting_narwhals < Drew> beefhound?
jconnolly <select multiple="multiple">
jconnolly is it that simple?
jconnolly also
jconnolly ant tomcat-content will rebuild your jsps without requiring a full rebuild and distribution of the war, I'm told.
jconnolly I just asked janks
jconnolly he's super nice and I'm to the point where I don't care about asking dumb questions
#team-chaos-monkey < jones> aturley: ~260k
#team-chaos-monkey < jones> aturley: no public/private joint venture parkland for you!

jconnolly et voila
jconnolly it's not an ant command, but you ant tomcat-copy-war, it'll put it in /opt/tomcat/webapps/ then you /opt/tomcat/bin/ladders-startup.sh
jconnolly there's no equivalent (that I know of) to mvn jetty:run
jconnolly all gooood
jconnolly both old-lw and hatch are like that
jconnolly I imagine so is RL
jconnolly maybe.
jconnolly he wants to programmatically upload and attach screenshots from webdriver failed tests and link to them in the logs
jconnolly "Log: ThisAFTTest failed: screenshot http://jconnolly-dev:8000/img/102913409254.jpg"
Drew hey
Drew what's the repo for the deploy scripts again?
Drew thx
jconnolly you pick up lunch yet?
jconnolly think I'm just going for some pizza
Drew hey
Drew can you come take a look at this?
mattjanks Are you working on that RL story then?
mattjanks If so, just want to update the Trello board.
jconnolly =/
jconnolly         $(disciplineDiv).children().children().attr("selected", false);
jconnolly run the fuck away.

gundel nice
gundel yeah, i think release-squid will turn out to be quite pleasant for everyone
jones so forgive me if this sounds crazy
jones setup.py insists on installing things to /usr/lib/pythno2.4/site-packages
jones that's right
jones worse
jones it installs somethings to 2.6 correctly
jones hmm i set pythonpath explicitly
jones PYTHON=/usr/bin/python26 PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.6/site-package /usr/bin/python26 ./setup.py bdist_rpm --python /usr/bin/python26  --packager 'Andrew Jones <ajones@theladders.com>'  --verbose
jones the generated specfile looks ok but is uhh definitely not ok
jones worse
jones the generated spec file looks just like every other python spec file i have, you know?
jones there's nothing that sticks out
jones  /usr/bin/python2.6 ./setup.py bdist_rpm --python /usr/bin/python2.6  --packager 'Andrew Jones <ajones@theladders.com>'  --verbose
jones ok this is actually working ow
jones as far as I know the only remaining step is to package fabric.
jones I don't expect to be that bad either
jones so I don't really have a good way to test this thing other than locally installing it on one of the jenkins QA nodes
jconnolly haha
jconnolly where'd you find that gem?
jconnolly PM?
jconnolly union programming
jconnolly I like it
jconnolly wat
Drew they match
Drew so it's not that
Drew do i need to run the install script every time?
Drew now i get this when i run it
Drew http://paste:8080/paste?c=dtn76
Drew oh wait...
Drew i need to be in the fighting-narwhals directory to run it
Drew http://paste:8080/paste?c=d5isg
Drew here's the error
Drew when i run it "correctly"
Drew kyle said we didn't specify where to deploy it
Drew in the pom.xml
Drew he said we should specify it in the parent pom
jconnolly I look at a shit ton of source and shudder
jconnolly linux kernel, userspace, vagrant, core java classes
jconnolly homebrew
jconnolly try ant clean dist
jconnolly it'll create that lib/ folder with the dependencies listed in .project
jconnolly that got rid of all the errors for me
jones i have considered buying one of these http://www.piengineering.com/xkeys.php to make up for the kinesis' terrible, terrible f-keys 	  				 	 	 	    		  	   		  		
jones more expensive than an awful midi hack but what is time worth 	  				 	 	 	    		  	   		  		
jones http://www.piengineering.com/xkeys/xk16stick.php specifically... 	  				 	 	 	    		  	   		  		
jones ...and it already has an sdk etc
jones i'm not sure that these are HID input devices ore not
jones but they definitely have linux+windows SDKs to talk to them
jones i assume so
jones if you think about it
jones the cost woulnd't scale to the keys
jones these are almost certainly made by hand in america
jones and they use cherry keyswitches, which are Not Cheap
jones this is an old enough company that they probably are injection molded 
jones also 3d printing would be really poorly suited to industrial applications
jones due to uncertain wear characteristics etc
jones whoops.
jones industrial 3d printers are a lot better than the home models
jones but they ain't gonna replace injection molded-anything...
jones several ex-tlc employees work for shapeways
jones which, while expensive, is fun as hell
jones http://www.shapeways.com/model/478731/40597449c5ddcb8e60893dcee3ff74ff 
jones i made this for myself after discovering the service, because it is just so damn cool
jones ryan juang made the plastic on
jones was it for prototyping, or did you actually give 3d printer output as finished products to consulting cutsomers?
jones i find this stuff hugely exciting
jones the quality of 3d printed parts is never going to be great
jones but being able to just feed in geometry and get out a part ready for finishing
jones wihtout paying a CNC dude $16 an hour and waiting a week
jones is awesome
jones it's like magic
jones i just meant that 
jones the nature of the beast
jones is that it's never going to be as good as CNC
jones all 3d printing processes have, as a design constraint
jones the idea that you can feed in ANY geometry within the bounds, and get reasonable output
jones CNC involves all kinds of thinking and planning and stuff
jones the actual geometry/code is the easy part
jones there's no way to encapsulate all the know-how and material behaviour in code/geometry :P
jones 3d printing sets out from the beginning, fuck getting it perfect, what CAN we do in a world where 100% of the info is stuffed in code :P
jones physical positivism
jones oh damn that is awesome
jones also
jones csg is way the fuck easier to use w/ shapeways
jones you are crazy if you try to use anything but wings3d
jones or, now, this
#enterprise < sean> aturley: http://www.mulgasoft.com
jones it is technically possible to use a regular 3d modeller and then post-process shit in another app to seal "leaks"
jones but i couldn't puzzle it out
darren -Dtestng.excluded.groups=broken
#freenode < BloodyFire> aturley: Hello.
sean we let todd go this morning
sean yes
sean this is all about todd's relationship with people outside of ux
sean in particular marc and alex
sean he and i did not get along at all
sean he loved to jokingly insult me 
sean selena for right now
sean they will be looking for someone
sean i have someone in mind, that kyri is going to talk to selena about setting up a meeting with
tk1 hi
tk1 it feels really strange
tk1 there's been injustice on this for a while.  but we all thought he was strong enough a leader and had knowledge
tk1 in both the marketing and UX disciplines to be in this role.
tk1 we all cared for him.
tk1 but, the goal is to maintain positive - and not let them think we are deterred from doing our jobs.
tk1 thanks for asking.
#team-chaos-monkey < daniel> aturley
#enterprise < kat> aturley, you said you have a branch for RL? Did you push it? 
#migration < cfield> aturley: don't give them too much credit...even the ipad3 has heating issues
jconnolly none
jconnolly ha!  I'm going to make some of my own tonight
jconnolly I think I'm going to eat a little later though
tk1 wait turley
tk1 missed this...what's all this about....
#team-chaos-monkey < kat> aturley:  what's up? I'm supposed to go interview someone momentarily.
#team-chaos-monkey < kat> aturley, if you're still having problems and want me to check out any particular code, let me know. 
kwinter1 how you making out?
kwinter1 haha
kwinter1 get into the onSubmit?
kwinter1 this might help:
kwinter1 http://users.tpg.com.au/fuzziman/blog/SimpleFormControllerCheatSheet_1.2.pdf
kwinter1 to understand the flow of the controller
kwinter1 shoot me any questions
kwinter1 I know the Spring MVC stuff pretty intimately
kwinter1 too much so in some cases..
#enterprise < kat> aturley, we also need to update the "What does the candidate see?" preview. You haven't done that, right?
jconnolly onSubmit
jconnolly so easy
jconnolly gimme a source file name, I'm curious
jconnolly what're you trying to do in there?
jconnolly To summarize, just to get to where we could add an object to the collection, we had to follow this chain of calls: new InitialContext () ~~> InitialContext.lookup~~> CustomerBean.addSubscription () -> CustomerBean.getSubscriptions () -> Collection.add (). An unbelievable 6 levels of indirection just to add a fucking object to a fucking collection. This is the kind of bullshit that chaps my ass purple and makes me want to eat babies.
jconnolly http://zedshaw.com/essays/indirection_is_not_abstraction.html
jconnolly ehh when there's this much magic I usually just step through an existing error...
jconnolly deh
jconnolly what the fuck is a .fm file?
jconnolly and a .ftld?
jconnolly darren might be able to help rescue you too if you get too deep
jconnolly I look at this and i think "thank christ I bought two cases of wine from Trader Joes"
jconnolly well, sacha made fresh home made hummus and falafel
jconnolly so I can not-think-about-this-and-be-happy as soon as I walk in the door
jconnolly it's nice not being on call too, got to admit
jconnolly and fresh tzatziki
jconnolly omnomish
jconnolly heh
jconnolly I usually walk in the door and do or put away some dishes
jconnolly because it's mindless
jconnolly eh I've been kicking the shit out of hatch the last week or so
jconnolly I'm glad I took one for the team and just jumped in
jconnolly like 7 or 8 cards moved into the 'released' column, I'm feeling alright lately
jconnolly indeed, I'm going to jump on RL next I think
jconnolly so I at least no where the messes lie
jconnolly *know
jconnolly alright fuck this noise I'm out
jconnolly had enough?  walk out?

mattjanks SaveSearchAjaxFormController is one
mattjanks Looks like we set the status to 202 for when errors happen within an ajax controller
mattjanks Create/RenameFolderAjaxFormController as well.
mattjanks Sweet.  No problem.  I don't mind at all.  Explaining to you helps me understand the craziness of RL as well.
mattjanks There are still many things in there I have no clue about.
jconnolly far is leaving makerbot
jconnolly bring him to theladders?  he'd love it
jconnolly dunno, he invited me to some nerdherders email list about being scrummasters
jconnolly it gets filtered as junk by sanemail but occasionally I'll read it
jconnolly did you get my imessage message about psemme?
mattjanks Any opposition to me creating a BE_CONTACTED branch for ladders-static-usrl?
mattjanks Will you need to at all?
mattjanks I'll leave it alone then until needed then.
mattjanks Okay.  I won't do anything then.
jconnolly thanks mate
jconnolly he should be getting in touch shortly
jconnolly macbook and power adapter should be in my desk
jconnolly heh
jconnolly nice that was quick
jconnolly sweet, now I'll buy the magsafe2 adapter
jconnolly and have THREE power supplies
jconnolly the saga continues!
jconnolly yeah
jconnolly they're just not cheap
jconnolly heh
#team-chaos-monkey < daniel> aturley or jconnolly, is there a page describing the release process for services to staging and production, e.g., tagging sources, gotchas, etc?
sean how you doing? what is your eta on landing that?
sean k
sean when janks gets done with email, i'm going to have him help out with whatever can be split off
#team-chaos-monkey < daniel> aturley, I've got a relsquid question for you
mattjanks How are things going on your end?  If you need anything, feel free to ask.
#enterprise < gundel> aturley and i were just using it
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley thinks i dont have a heart
gundel https://confluence.laddersoffice.com:8443/display/TECH/Test+Credit+Card
gundel who put that there?
gundel the expiration date is any date in the future
gundel cvv code and zip code are similarly abstract values
gundel that is to say, irrelevant

VishMac how the hell r ya
gundel https://confluence.laddersoffice.com:8443/display/NLW/Building+and+running+new-lw+locally

jconnolly we patched up but not to that degree
jconnolly I don't think so
jconnolly At least he responded that he's glad we cleared that up
jconnolly can't have that kind of bad juju out there

mattjanks You didn't merge to default, did you?
kat Thank you!
mattjanks K, cool.
mattjanks I'm going to try and release this multi-disciplpine stuff tonight 
mattjanks sucks about the schema change...
mattjanks :/
mattjanks saturday?
mattjanks really?
mattjanks this is true
mattjanks :)
VishMac Kevin Shultx
VishMac Shultz
VishMac he was at bug before i even got there
VishMac prolly a total dweeb
sean how goes it?
kat Findbugs is complaining about IntroductionFormBean's equals method
kat Bug: com.theladders.recruit.introduction.IntroductionFormBean.equals(Object) does not check for null argument
kat This implementation of equals(Object) violates the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals() because it does not check for null being passed as the argument. All equals() methods should return false if passed a null value.
jconnolly heh
jconnolly for what?
jconnolly I mean what components
jconnolly hm, interesting
jconnolly I don't even know where to start for my card
jconnolly the 187 comment code review is right in the middle of where I'll be working
jconnolly and until that dust settles it doesn't make much sense to start
jconnolly even if I did know where that'd be
jconnolly yeaaah...
jconnolly kyle did about 3/4ths of the front end work for my card in that branch
jconnolly and holy fuck backbone
jconnolly gonna need to pair on this... it hits the orchestration layer, models, all the way down
kat https://jira.laddersoffice.com:7201/browse/DB-3588 <— jira issue
jconnolly still there?
jconnolly heh
jconnolly I don't know actually, there are no other unit tests in rl around email?
jconnolly I just bear that pain in code review
jconnolly recruiter@example.com seems to fit
jconnolly for lw, we ususually do "jsUnitTest"+System.currentTimeMillis+"@theladders.com"
jconnolly for things like signups, to prevent dupes
jconnolly haha it's all good mate
jconnolly they're gentle in enterprise
jconnolly consumer is where you need to bring your own lube
mattjanks Offering my coding services if needed.
mattjanks Cool, very nice.
mattjanks Yeah.
mattjanks ah, okay.
mattjanks let me update to your branch and see what's changed
mattjanks i can look into the AFTs.
mattjanks cool
mattjanks did we want to merge default into your branch at some point before merging back down?
mattjanks hrm, getting compile issues when i try to build.  is that expected?
mattjanks hah
mattjanks sounds good
mattjanks k
mattjanks i'm just deploying it locally getting things set up while keeping an eye on the release.
kat FYI Ken went along with not altering contact_tracking and adding a separate table.
kat Easy enough. 
kat I just need him to create the table now..
jconnolly are you a fan of george saunders?
jconnolly he's got a story in the new yorker... first collection of short stories in 6 years coming out second or third week in january
jconnolly I personally love him
jconnolly well, civilwarland in bad decline was awesome
jconnolly short and terrifying reign of phil was pretty good
jconnolly but yeah, good read for the commute home: http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/10/31/111031fi_fiction_saunders?currentPage=all

jflohrs i was wondering if something was off with my connection 
jflohrs correct. 
jflohrs let me know if i can take a look at it when you have it in a good state
kwinter 1 - yea I think profile makes sense
kwinter 2 - it doesn't look like it does anything with the function, so we can probably kill it?

#enterprise < kat> aturley, I see you moved "New LW should not show filled job in matches/search" to the Code Review/QA column? Is there a code review? 
jeremy You're working on 'new lw should not show filled jobs' card?  I imagine that should be pretty straight forward to test.  Any idea  if that's the case?
jeremy like, any filled job, or a specific type of filled/removed/rejected/expired job?
jeremy i can probably find one quickly
jeremy in qa?
jeremy harvested or jreq?
jeremy jobId=1795865
jeremy filled
jeremy by 'find one' i mean i found a job and marked it as filled
jeremy it's quite old though
jeremy Job Location Id 1947507 
jeremy if you want me to create jobs in particular states i can do that
jeremy didnt notice at first that that job is old. i can get a newer one if you want
jeremy created 800099880 (location 800003821 ) and marked it as filled
jeremy sadly that's probably faster than ladders data setup creates jobs
jeremy haha
jeremy Those are important
laura http://solr-jobs-qa-1:8080/admin/dataimport.jsp?handler=/dataimport
laura you can run "Delta import"
laura but if you do something like we did in the recommenders, you don't have to reindex
laura solrServer.commit(); <- will add to index
laura did he create one with a job function and a discipline?
laura is it this one? jobid: 800095019
jeremy yeah that job never came up in search. dont know if something is borked in qa or what.  guess i could look for a filled job in production
jeremy except i dont have a new lw user in production
jeremy any good leads?
jeremy is it possible that the job was created and then filled too quickly, so it would never get indexed?
jeremy well then it's mildly distressing that my kittens job never showed up in search
laura we only keep jreqs that are filled in the index -- i think the job has subscriber_id = null 
laura i just changed it
laura from null to 0
jeremy uh
jeremy isnt sub id null on harvested jobs?
jeremy qa db is being slow, possibly because it hates me
jeremy hm
jeremy maybe it's 0 and not null
jeremy it is 0 on the job i posted
jeremy on that job specifically?
jeremy nope
jeremy Does that make sense to you that you wouldn't see it?
jeremy So that rule means once a harvested job is filled it wont show up.  Er. Is that the business rule or the .. uh.. what's currently implemented in the code?
jeremy hm
jeremy //hm//
jeremy i wonder if salary bands are why i dont see it
jeremy null pointer exception!
jconnolly heh that's awesome
jeremy in hatch, editing a user's disciplines
jeremy i blamed john because he touched this at some point
jeremy but it occured to me that i might not have seen the job in search if my salary bands are different than the job
kwinter you released the JS service?
kwinter awesome, thanks
kwinter only issue was me trying to install shit to release it
kwinter but if it's already up we're good
kwinter saved me a bunch o trouble
kwinter it's getting pissy about installing
kwinter can battle that some other time
kwinter Running PyYAML-3.10/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/easy_install-KcFvn4/PyYAML-3.10/egg-dist-tmp-7A9PwD
kwinter ext/_yaml.c:4:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
kwinter compilation terminated.
kwinter error: Setup script exited with error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
kwinter ah
kwinter nah, of course not
kwinter now it's happy, thanks
jeremy anyway, so subscriber_id on jobs is null for harvested jobs.  What did you say earlier about it has to be non-null?
jconnolly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_FeErS-gDo
jeremy Status: A doesn't require a subscriber_id 
jeremy So... I can forget the whole subid thing?
jeremy ok cool
jeremy anytime
jconnolly finally getting messages from rabbitmq
jconnolly jesus christ that took way longer than it should've
jconnolly heh
jconnolly actually, this is the true test
jconnolly hg revert --all and see if it works without my mucking about
jconnolly woohoo!
sean ok
sean a little tired but good overall
sean it was low key and restful
sean ny
sean how was yours?
sean i watched a show on kc bbq
sean it made me hungry
sean no reservations
sean none yet
sean get busy!
gundel going well, yourself?
gundel sounds overrated, more vacation seems like the more sane option
gundel nope, don't think there have been any new lw releases this week
gundel also, no ops anyway
gundel sounds good
sean nope
sean i just did it 30 seconds
sean i'm a cowboy
sean or really
sean there is basically no one on the site right now
sean so fuck it
john hey
john alright, trying to power through converting these jsp-based emails to freemarker with no good way of verifying my freemarker
john it's tedious
john basically, or attempt an email and watch tomcat crash as a result of very badly formed freemarker
sean yeah
sean we should
john how're you doing?
john exhausting holiday week?
john I'm completely shot, need a good 12 hour sleep but haven't gotten more than 4-5hrs... and tomorrow sacha wants to have my family over here
john ah, who's in omaha?
john I'm hoping the snow will scare them off
john exactly
john they're already starting to bail... huzzah!
john oh really?  intapp?
john fucking bonus... after taxes 401k etc was less than 4K
john fwp, I know, but guh
john RON PAUL 4 LIFE
john well congrats that's good news
john who'se the acquiring company?
john heh, interesting
john well nice
john maybe indeed will buy theladders and my 1K worth of stock will be worth something someday
john for people with college educations
john ugh
john http://www.theerlangelist.com/
john someone had to do it at some point I guess
john portmanteauing erlang
john heh
john dude was pushed in front of a 7 train at my usual stop last night around 8
john madness
john on the plus side, I'm a lot more comfortable with rabbitmq
john eh not really, I mean it's a shame she's still on the run...  but last month a guy butchered his wife in his 39th st apartment, walked to the 40th st subway stop and plunged himself onto the sidewalk, killing himself
john I think I'm going to start using the 46th st station... it's equidistant anyway
john gonna be this kind of start to 2013 eh, old-lw?
john http://paste:8080/paste?c=p35n
john heh, nope linux
john I'm going all-mac this week
christina $BUILD_DIR/target/webapp
jeremy looking through old code reviews, in be-33 you said you were going to write an integration test to make sure filled jobs are being excluded.  Have you worked on that yet?
b9punk fo ril
b9punk lunvh?
b9punk lunch, even?
b9punk we're thinking do hwa
b9punk sweet
b9punk i think her name is tatiana, and i don't know what she does
b9punk i haven't tested the waters
b9punk but i know exactly what you mean
john new BI person maybe?
john new noah?
john sitting next to zhen, good probablity
b9punk yummy
john there was an opening for his position, don't see it open anymore
john http://careers.theladders.com/
john wtf
john what do you see with chrome/linux for http://careers.theladders.com/ ?
john the transition for those images results in this insane bouncy transition
john let it run for a few minutes
john look at my screen
john ah you missed it
john but yeah, the overlayed text and background just bounch for about 45s
john yeah that's what I was thinking
john mac chrome yeah
john safari no
john anyway weird
john Caused by: freemarker.core.ParseException: Unexpected end of file reached.
john fuck you freemarker and your ambiguous exceptions
john fwiw, if you ever have to work on freemarker hatred
john use intellij
john haaaa yeah
john the alternative is jsps
john they both suck
john but whatever our renderingengine for jsps is bound to request/session scope.  so if I want to pepper my emails with things like, say, the job applicant's name, it's authenticated.user.name.  which is no good if the event is coming from rabbitmq (there's no request/session context because the event is bound to a request) so I have to figure out how to stick my dick in this
john yes exactly
john think you might go to jen's friday?
john I'm thinking about it, Sacha needs to meet city peoples and jen is so welcoming and nice
john convience her, it'll be fun
john and if not, we'll skip out and get a drink at one of the many nice bars in the area
john i miss that area
john no worries... sach and I are similar like that
john but I think I'm going to force myself over my "eh it's the end of the week and I'd rather sit back and read and enjoy some wine than schlep to brooklyn in the subzero weather" hump
john jesus, it's 4
#enterprise < jeremy> aturley channels his inner serial killer
b9punk i have
b9punk but why do you insist on torturing me?
b9punk ;)
b9punk i think i will stop the diet this month or next
b9punk until then, i refuse to believe in sugar
b9punk sugar loves me
b9punk until then i have kpop
b9punk and that's sweet enough
b9punk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihi_kJJj_8A&list=ALzxNYRMVOCRjPrJpPdzNFiRz5rVVoO-6m
b9punk i couldn't tell you, but i'm obsessed
b9punk south koreans are the ultimate white people i think
b9punk nothing amuses them
b9punk they have to go to very far lengths just to find an aesthetic that challenges them
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/erlang/
jeremy for that filled jobs integration test idea, is that going have its own card for writing the tests?
jeremy i think we talked about this briefly before the holidays.  Can you insert test data into the solr indexes or whatever, then assert your query gives what you expect?
jeremy Seems pretty straight forward.  Is there a catch?
jeremy hm.  where would the test be more valuable?  i'd guess the search client, since that's more likely to change in such a way that the functionality breaks? 
jeremy sounds like a win
darren it has it's pros and cons
darren nah, it's a similar problem / predicament that we've been working around for a while
jeremy that's a promising headline
laura1 hey andy
laura1 heard you talking to darren about checking for solr syntax

#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley, kat - you never got back to me about ErlangDC
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley- i have to say, i have no idea how CacheControlHeader works
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: pass=`cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[:graph:]' | head -c 8` ; echo $pass
jconnolly that seems like a good idea
jconnolly they open at 6, so if we leave ~6 we should get there before it gets too crowded
jconnolly say we'll aim to get there for 6:30?
jconnolly maybe duck out 10 mins early
jconnolly no, I'm 99% certain they take credit/debit too
jconnolly I can probably check my debit history and find out ;D
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley even
mattjanks You're heading to the meetup tonight, correct?
mattjanks ah, crap.  that sucks.  i thought you were for some reason.
mattjanks I'm waiting for the organizer (Peter) before I do anything.

#enterprise < mattjanks> aturley, sean, peter, i might start upgrading the pipeline topology to 0.8.2 sometime during lunch and see how it goes.  if it's relatively painless, we might be able to do the entire upgrade early next week (depending on prodops availability of course).

mattjanks storm-match-email?
mattjanks storm-nlw-matches-email
mattjanks storm-matches-email
mattjanks storm-jobseeker-job-matches
mattjanks Is the most recent top candidate.
mattjanks Yeah.  The only reason I'm hesitant to add "email" is b/c it's not actually sending the email.
mattjanks It's just prepping data.
mattjanks I'll call it storm-jobseeker-job-matches.  We can always change the name it uses when deployed to Storm.
mattjanks Thx.
jconnolly not if jeremy keeps being so fucking good at his job.

daniel hey, you around?
daniel no problem
daniel we actually already fixed the issue anyway
daniel it was around the broken login page on new LW
daniel but everything's okay now
daniel you can see my commit for what needed to change
daniel we don't actually use login.html
daniel the security context also needed to be updated
daniel no, no problem
daniel do you happen to know why we're using JSPs for cachebusting?
daniel what about using moustache?
daniel since that's what we're using for templating
warman11985 hey
warman11985 are you guys going to do templates for those jsps?
warman11985 ok, just checking because im building a 404 page
warman11985 that will be a copy and paste of cancellation confirmation
daniel I guess it was more about using something other than JSPs
daniel but it's not a big deal
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: did you email the folks at apistrategies?

john I need to dig into that erlang book
john (I'm actually kind of enjoying scala, I think I'm going to spend the next two weeks powering through this "Well grounded java developer" book then onto "Programming in scala")
john right
john eh I still need an intermediary between my procedural-minded nature and pure fp a la lisp
john scala, then clojure
john I read programming language pragmatics, played a lot with fp and logical programming languages but it's all atrophied 
john I need to totally go over it all again, the paradigms are there
john heh yeah
john what's for lunch?
john I might go to that B-health rated buffet-crap place on hudson, they have reasonably good salad options
john ah nice, alright

john gonna sign up for the Y tomorrow night

kwinter any idea where sean and the new guys are?
sean i had a completely insane idea for new lw last night
mattjanks I'm looking into the old LW code just to get a feel for some of the things we did for resume critique.
mattjanks And for examples on what NOT to do :)
kwinter don't even know what it's for
kwinter I don't see job_rate anywhere in XML or Java though
kwinter sorry for what?
kwinter oh no worries
kwinter I'd be the best one to know at this point
kwinter what's the table for?  maybe we just haven't built it yet
kwinter or what are you trying to figure out?
kwinter I don't see it in Old LW either...
kwinter I wonder if that's the "fit rating" for jobs
kwinter yea it would have
kwinter thumbs up, thumbs down
kwinter so it's the jobseeker rating how well the job relates to them I belive
kwinter yea they'd be a good place
kwinter I think it was a 'Connections' project
kat What's up?
kwinter yea that seems weird to me too
kwinter I assume that if they apply, we automatically add an entry into it
kwinter since it clearly must have been relevant
kat I don't think you can rate jobs in new LW, right?
kat Hm, interesting.
kwinter 4666796

john - Job Alerts is really about driving re-engagement and conversion, Job Alerts happens to currently be our best driver of this in existing LW.
john - Stress is a term borrowed from sports-based analogies of performance.  Specifically, the book called Lore of Running, http://www.amazon.com/Lore-Running-4th-Timothy-Noakes/dp/0873229592 I'm looking for a better to describe it in development. Pace?

mattjanks I'm ready to tackle design whenever you are ready.
mattjanks I added a link to the story giving a high-level view of what we need to do for "creating a resume critique".
mattjanks I don't think our model needs to necessarily follow that diagram.
mattjanks Updated the link for the high-level view.  Should be "more" correct now.

jconnolly on the dev blog
jconnolly Big business isn't the only one looking to enrich the technology industry.
jconnolly Mayor Michael Bloom-berg constantly touts the growth of tech companies and has come up with several initiatives to incubate business over the last couple of years.
jconnolly why is Bloom-berg hyphenated?
jconnolly does amny even have a copy editor?
jconnolly "hey do you read AMNY?"
jconnolly me: "hmmmm no"
jconnolly "ahhh yeah, well hehe, I kinda shamefully do.  Well there was a post in there about how NYC is AWESOME FOR TECH!"

jconnolly linkedin is stupid
jconnolly LinkedIn has informed me that my profile is in the top 1% of most viewed profiles amongst their 200 million strong membership: Did everyone receive this??
jconnolly ^^ mike deissig
jconnolly "I have verified that the number is bullshit through an ad-hoc experiment. I posted my 1% and a poll asking others to post theirs as well. So far 0 response? If I was in the top 1%, there would have been a response."

jconnolly Alex: "WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF THIS FIRST?"
jconnolly "hmm, maybe if we change it to top 2%?  we could do that?"
jconnolly I need an actionable engineering initiative

jconnolly haha
jconnolly i'm going to avoid the sexist joke here
jconnolly actually I can probably rework it to not be sexist
jconnolly without "it looks better at night", most of us wouldn't be alive, amirite?
jconnolly haha
jconnolly how's that going?
jconnolly http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php
jconnolly I'm saying for me at least, day-1 is all track 3

john Brand ambassadorships aren’t usually so raucous.

john Although TheLadders’ reputation is to hook up high-earners with high-paying jobs, part of Augustine’s job description is to reach out to the under-30 crowd, many of whom would consider a job at Costco a sweet deal given the current economy.

mattjanks i agree

john eh
john details coming in now
john sacha's enamored but I'm skeptical
john 3br?  really?  how many living rooms?
john oh no living room?
john so it's a 2br
john oh backyard access?
john oh but only through a window.
john but the other unit has a door, maybe he'd put in a door where the window is now.
john eh I'm le skeptical.  looks like yuppies lived there before though.
john why yes
john how come you got the fancy stand and all the accoutrements?
john yeah
john well that's a given
tk1 hey is there a bunny channel in IRC
tk1 ?
tk1 c'est cool
tk1 merci
daniel hey, do the python changes in this code review look okay to you?
daniel http://fisheye.laddersoffice.com/cru/CR-KOALA-48
sean so lights on both walls are on the same switch
sean the lights
sean that is why i had them undo the one over me
sean i too was once very pissed about that
daniel cool, thanks
tk1 hey turley how are you doing?
tk1 srry i was teasing you at kai's desk....you could of stood there and talked shit about numbers with us:)
tk1 okay.  sorry my humor can be obnoxious
tk1 hahaaaaaa.  that's where the party is usually at.
tk1 http://www.harvestworks.org/mar-1-gh-hovagimyan-3d-karaoke-with-the-kinect/
tk1 speaking of...here's an idea for Kinect.  i bet we could even get gergen in the office this way.....
tk1 ya, it does.  i have friends in town from CHI and likely couldn't drag them.
tk1 but 
tk1 fun concept to think on....
tk1 ummmm
tk1 they are the collective that rehabs old arcade games, yes?
tk1 or develops new out of the old??
tk1 i wasn't sure if they were still around....
tk1 they had a couple of their pieces up at Death by Audio last time i was there.
tk1 is that the NYU poly program?
tk1 downstairs?
tk1 well they have a location in bkly
tk1 too i think
tk1 i think they are 
tk1 but this one downstairs in more business/start up focused
tk1 then bklyn is more experiment interactive products
tk1 I KNOW
tk1 give the kids some fun before they have to become working stiffs like us.
tk1 why rush them into things.
tk1 i wish we could both quit our day jobs.
tk1 i'd be much happier writing my sci fi stories
tk1 making my wearable tech projects
tk1 and art installations
tk1 my ideas for those are much more inventive then anything i can come up with 
tk1 for interfaces
tk1 :)
tk1 someday we'll get there
tk1 sure, what's her story?
tk1 did she quit her day job?@?@?
tk1 cool
tk1 ugggh
tk1 okay 
tk1 i'll give her that.
tk1 aha!
tk1 i see for sure
tk1 then gergen should def meet her.
tk1 totally!
tk1 hmm
tk1 does she have any angst
tk1 star west?
tk1 OH GOOD
tk1 then she can relate to us.
tk1 angst breeds complexity
tk1 and originality :D
tk1 cool!!!!
tk1 she's gotta come visit!
tk1 she can read my stories and carve them up.
tk1 THEY NEED IT.
tk1 seriouslu
tk1 i just suddently had some stories to tell and needed to write them.
tk1 they came from nowhere really 
tk1 and honestly i don't know what the hell i'm doing.
tk1 :)
tk1 um you seem to
tk1 ooo
tk1 do you have some you are working with already?
tk1 stop it.
tk1 don't do that.
tk1 keep them going.
tk1 don't rewatch the battlestar galactica series over and over again like you do
tk1 :)
tk1 i'm not going to drop this stuff anymore....b/c its my ticket to quitting my day job.
tk1 lol
tk1 okay let's lunch and come up with a kinect concept
tk1 at some point....and we can't drop it.
tk1 okay yes.  sounds good.
tk1 right!
tk1 like ol' sol lewitt would say....
tk1 Since no form is intrinsically superior to another, the artist may use any form, from an expression of words (written or spoken) to physical reality, equally.
tk1 yes i'm saturday
tk1 are you planning to?
tk1 sounds like it could be interesting....
tk1 this one i WILL drag my friends to for sure.
tk1 sometimes hack days are horribly unorganized 
tk1 and sometimes they are just organized enough to be interesting.
tk1 yes - and honestly
tk1 a lot of times they spend too much time to just get the technology working
tk1 and not enough on what the point of the art actually is.
tk1 or making it satifyingly 'artistic'
tk1 that's the really exciting part.
tk1 or the meaningful
tk1 that's a good idea.
tk1 or curate a theme
tk1 like use crazy art to express the angst ridden inner child
tk1 absolutely
tk1 i know in one of my seminars
tk1 i tried to make this interactive video installation
tk1 in a public space inside the art building at UIC
tk1 i fucking beat my head against the wall with the damn arduino, timing of all the quick time files
tk1 and in the end i just played the video
tk1 i just pressed play.
tk1 and people loved.
tk1 everyone faculty, random people in the building, etc
tk1 uhuh.
tk1 indeed...i should have made the quality of the video better!  spent more time on shooting , editing etc
tk1 making the sound better.
tk1 so yup
tk1 completely wrong problem.
tk1 'out-of-band'
tk1 what is this?
tk1 indeed!
tk1 true...
tk1 right
tk1 sometimes its good to work through little ideas...approach them like prototypes
tk1 yes
tk1 and NOT DROP ALL YOUR idea
tk1 s
tk1 :)
tk1 okay i gotta wire a bit.
tk1 ttyl and we'll concept soon....
tk1 thx!
tk1 egggggggg
tk1 okay
tk1 they are now objects
tk1 now items for consumption....
tk1 or well....
tk1 i guess it depends on the CONCEPTTT
tk1 if in fact
tk1 we then eat them.
tk1 get it???
tk1 haaaa.
tk1 well 
tk1 we have to define 
tk1 'gross'
tk1 perhaps??
tk1 or we can make a universe of only moons and hang them up?
tk1 so it'd be the solar system but only include
tk1 our moon
tk1 the moons of mars
tk1 moons of saturn
tk1 all EXCEPT the planets?
tk1 there is the 'moon' concept there too!
tk1 waxing 
tk1 waning
tk1 ?
tk1 wasn't the moon initial thought of as a piece of cheese?
tk1 hmmmmm
tk1 no no
tk1 cheese = moon
tk1 pie = moon
tk1 grilled moon pie = grilled cheese
tk1 it would be interesting what their physical properties actually are
tk1 that might generate a concept
tk1 what about if we fry them?
tk1 or try to set them on fire?
tk1 pour hydrocloric acid on them?
tk1 leave them outside all night?
tk1 leave them in the sun too long??!?
tk1 OOOOOOO
tk1 moons too exposed to the sun? 
tk1 hahahah
tk1 um sort of?
tk1 totally
tk1 yes!
tk1 ooooo
tk1 good idea.
tk1 i'm sure we have something orange
tk1 totally!
tk1 sunkissed moon pie?
tk1 exactly
tk1 maybe we could hang it in a very large room
tk1 and hang an arrow next to it
tk1 pointing to it
tk1 and right a parody of the 'pale blue dot' intro
tk1 except its the pale yellow dot
tk1 the banana moon pie
tk1 like a huge mult-channel 
tk1 system to play the story on.
tk1 something :)
tk1 next to
tk1 the pale yellow dot
tk1 oooooooooooo
tk1 true
tk1 or the powers of ten
tk1 is based on how many moon pies you eat at once
tk1 the power of 4 moon pies
tk1 hahaha
tk1 then we'd run out of resources.
tk1 part of the fun is to get rid of something that we have no use for...
tk1 or no use for, relative to their intended use
john indeed!
john thank christ, I didn't know if I was going to survive February

sean well the one older one
sean and then there is the new one
sean you know the goals and the python the best, so i'm leaning on you in those reviews.
mrbeefy let's see how q1 budget shakes out
mrbeefy we are behind in datacenter build which is going to cost us 27K this month
christina is this the one: CR-CON-1253 ?
john I honestly don't know.  the weird part is often you'll find conflicting uses
john go to a deli, get a grilled cheese, they'll wrap it in aluminum, then butcher paper
john go to a deli, get an egg sandwich and they'll use the paper/aluminum combo that wraps it in paper, then aluminum

kwinter in and out
kwinter gotta meet with gary quick
kwinter should be free after that
christina any chance u can merge head into ur branch
christina thankss
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley is going to do one on the release strategy, 12 factor stuff etc
christina thanks dude
christina can u do me a favor
christina haha nvm got it
kwinter What we have here is a name collision between the real world and our code
kwinter what do you mean?
kwinter gotcha, yea I knew that
kwinter and our service_request table
kwinter which is loads of fun
kwinter I had meant we could drop service because we don't really seem to talk about it or think about it that way
frankm yo
frankm works!
kulc curious, who do you login as
kulc good enough
mattjanks oh boy...
mattjanks what a gem.
mattjanks That's a fair assumption.
mattjanks At least initially, that was the assumption I was taking.
kwinter btw, you don'
kwinter 't necessarily have to do all the AppException BS, with Log level and all that jazz
kwinter if that's what you meant in the review
kwinter gotcha, just making sure you didn't think you had to worry about all that other stuff
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley, daniel => https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter
#team-chaos-monkey < daniel> aturley, there's also "emacs rocks" which is fun

tk1 oh?
tk1 what's he think of the 3rd ward class?
tk1 CRT
tk1 s
tk1 Televisions?
tk1 so would it not short circuit

tk1 did you say you'd like to collaborate with him??
tk1 there is this class at genspace i'm considering
tk1 two friends of mine are going to...its a NYResistor/Genspace collaborative effort
tk1 http://genspace.org/event/20130321/1900/Arduino%20Wet%20Pong
tk1 ha haa.
tk1 i know - 
tk1 but it is indeed, the future.
tk1 Its mucho dinero...but I will think on it.  I'm embarrassingly non-connected to the resistor team
tk1 even though i try to make all this tech art.
tk1 enslaving? 
tk1 no
tk1 collaborating?
tk1 yes:D
tk1 the future is here!
tk1 maybe cats
tk1 and the kinect?
tk1 think they'd understand the interaction?
tk1 they are intelligent animals and seem responsive enough to our technologies
tk1 haha. EVEN BETTER!
tk1 careful, the more we treat them like drones
tk1 the more apt they are to turn against us.
tk1 collapse our civilization.
tk1 indeed.....i would agree.
tk1 agreed.
tk1 have you seen life of brian?
tk1 monty python film?
tk1 <i'm assuming>
tk1 oh okay.
tk1 well its essentially a parody of the story of jesus
tk1 and of course the jews are against the romans
tk1 oh god. too long a reference.
tk1 http://youtu.be/ExWfh6sGyso
tk1 essentially they're bitching about the romans
tk1 and then they realize how much civilization the romans have built around them.
tk1 thus
tk1 the cats - this is what they will do for us
tk1 EXACTLY
tk1 you should see this movie by the way...

christina resume.notfound
christina "codes" :  ["resume.not-found]
christina i dunno if its wrapped as an array or not
christina yeah it doesnt matter 
christina array or not
christina horray
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley
daniel-at-home back again?
daniel-at-home I thought we could work together on the resume critique project a bit
daniel-at-home so we make sure that legacy messiness doesn't unduly affect new LW
daniel-at-home if you haven't yet, take a look at the code review comments I left to get a general idea
daniel-at-home I was thinking that there might be something we could do to make the legacy libraries more "respectable"
daniel-at-home a little more polished
daniel-at-home maybe a facade or two
daniel-at-home so that less of that "legacy feel" spills out of them into our code
daniel-at-home nulls
daniel-at-home Integer ids
daniel-at-home I think there are some things like companyId that no longer make sense
daniel-at-home that we can wrap up and hide away
daniel-at-home so that apps that use the libraries don't need to worry about it
daniel-at-home maybe some of what has already been implemented in your code review can actually be pushed down into the libraries themselves
daniel-at-home yeah, I think that as long as comments are coming in, and there's active conversation happening, it's worth keeping open
daniel-at-home sure
daniel-at-home I think it's useful to see how things fit together in new LW first
daniel-at-home and then once that's done, we'll have a clearer idea of what needs to go where
daniel-at-home so I think what's in the code review is a first step towards that
daniel-at-home also, that one Java config file that brings in all the legacy DAOs might be a good point to start tracing interdependencies between different legacy components 
daniel-at-home when we eventually do create a facade or anti-corruption layer
john http://www.businessinsider.com/career-advice-from-linkedins-founder-2013-3?op=1
john career advice
john sohotritenow
john is that true?  I could see it being true
john  It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one - the “CEO of their own career” - and draws parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[

john SIMON: Vinita Honda-Koller of Baldwin, Long Island, lost her job as a software engineer a year ago as her company sent jobs overseas and the skills she developed over two decades became dated.
john VINITA HONDA-KOLLER: First of all, being let go was traumatic. The day I was let go, my last day I was walking to Penn Station from the office and I called my mother and I said to her, you know, they finally did it, I am a little big shocked. And she said to me, no, this is a big shock.
john SIMON: And what's the job search been like for you emotionally and practically?
john HONDA-KOLLER: My self-confidence has been a little bit shattered. During one of the interviews this man was very, very intimidating. It was a phone interview. He was asking me technical questions. When I didn't answer what he wanted to hear, he hung up on me. And another interview, they wanted to take all my electronics to make sure that I wouldn't cheat on the technical test they were giving me.
john So that was also very, very intimidating and I think that was the first time I cried after an interview.
john I almost threw my phone out the window

john 11:49 <sean-at-home> work out kinks. find new tools
john 11:49 <sean-at-home> start of q3, we make that 1 day a week

john it was funny
john daniel asked me after my 4th or 5th week
john "so what do you think?  any observations ?"
john I said "well, there's a shitload of engineers, I kinda don't get what everyone is doing"
john 2 weeks later they fire half of the engineering team

john then just do it!
tk1 miller puckette is a site to behold.
tk1 no no haven't seen these.
tk1 He is a regular guy, is he not?
tk1 Actually, let me make a blanket statement
tk1 The audiophilic open source ppl are the kindest ones i've found
tk1 least pretentious.
tk1 at the PD conference it was just alllll love. i tell ya.
tk1 they are.
tk1 its definitely a community, no pretense.
tk1 supportive of those trying to learn...
tk1 i learned it in grad school
tk1 but it took me a few tutorials after school (while lucid) to wrap my head around it .
tk1 its a whole different language indeed. and the tutorial/manuals are allll over the place.
tk1 and the instructional text is written in klingon
tk1 it is, right???
tk1 max is easier to pick up 
tk1 because the language is written in english.
tk1 it isn't actually - easy transition.
tk1 indeed....
tk1  YES
tk1 groovy thanks

john booyah
john you'd have sent an email out if you were on consumer.prod-support
john really, it's drew's fault
john CUSTOMER ACQUIRED
john agreed
john IIRC he ran an architectural firm?
john I just figured out how to fetch updates from an upstream github repo
john how did I go so long not knowing that?
kwinter did you release the fixes yet, or still waiting?
kwinter ok
kwinter I've got something now that needs to go out today as well
kwinter yea
kwinter haven't tested it
kwinter don't know if we really need to
kwinter if it breaks prod, I don't think we really give a fuck anyway
kwinter we we're sending back Jobseeker IDs as part of Scout
kwinter for other Jobseekers
kwinter *were
kwinter yea
kwinter I can cherry pick it to the release branch if you want
kwinter although I don't see anything on server default that really affects much, do you?
kwinter (the webapp change doesn't matter for this)
kwinter only thing is refactorings around the city state space parser
kwinter but fuck it, I'll just transplant quick
frankm are you building?
frankm nlw
kwinter up to you
kwinter I just transplanted
kwinter and pushed
kwinter so it's both on the branch and on default
frankm ready for staging

jeremy Did you work on job matches?
jeremy the email for it
jeremy unsub doesnt seem to work
jeremy reported by suz. im making a jira for it
jeremy guess you're blameless
jeremy i wasnt sure how it was supposed to work
jeremy but she said it should be the same as the other unsub email links
jeremy are you trying to do something to new lw qa1?

john where are you seeing large Xmx values in staging?
john I see 512m everywhere
frankm are we going from QA to Prod or is there a staging environment?
jeremy Are signature users different for this resume thing?
jeremy i dont know what state my user /should/ be in
frankm ok
jeremy where does ST get the target job title from?
jeremy because it doesnt match what i have in new lw
jeremy set sr.free_service_request_time = now() - interval 1 year -- should show me the critique again right?

frankm did we go live?
frankm and there is the email...
frankm splunk already looks happier
kwinter btw, while you're in there
kwinter the merge methods on ResumeCritique really look more like creation methods
kwinter so maybe a static factory method that accepts (serviceRequest, simpleCritique)?

sean we will find out over time
john yeah I asked kai to put me on a few days before he even announced it... 
john they're like youtube comments
john thank christ the reply-to isn't the user's email address
john http://tributary.io/
john for playing dynamically with d3
john pretty fucking awesome
john seeing shit like that makes me question the credibility of any speakers anywhere ever 
john actually what I liked about nofluff
john is they had an initial slide with the technical background and credentials of the speaker
john "look I know what I'm about to talk about"
john and they limit it to like 50 words
john not that fucking bullshit tome next to meetzee's avatar
john how'd you find that?
jeremy Working on anything I can help with today?
jeremy jones said something about jetty 9 changes
jeremy and he'd talk to drew
jeremy Do you know about that stuff already?
john good on riak
john - Good and bad use cases for Riak
john webinar at 2 going over an intro to riak
john that's the first bulletpoint
jeremy I don't know much about it.  This morning qa wasnt working, redeploy didnt work, asked around, got pointed to Jones
john couchbase was all "realational is dead!  you need a datastore?  couchbase! 0 to running in minutes"
jeremy So are you probably going to be working on the career history stuff?
jeremy and/or do you remember how it and visibility work?
jeremy ... that sounds unpleasant
tk1 http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2013/program
jeremy http://paste:8080/paste?c=dv1fo
jeremy there's a column in jobseeker_experience "profile_item_status_id" but i dont know what that is.  my user has 3, 1, 3, null
jeremy oh. that table just isn't in bisql02
jeremy awesome
jeremy Talked to tesia about the design stuff?
jeremy nope
jeremy (4:51:24 PM) jeremy: Any update on the jetty/qa thing?
jeremy (4:52:34 PM) jones: I'm still working.
jeremy uhh so with the career history thing... i think everyone on new lw who tried to save their history and didnt work will have many many rows?
#team-chaos-monkey < peter> aturley: it's called innovation
jeremy so for active users who subscribed after 2010, the vast majority have <10 jobs
jeremy are you able to sign in via http://lw-qa-1.lb.laddersoffice.net/login ?
jeremy for some reason i cant sign in in chrome
jeremy no errors, just redirects me back to login
jeremy works in ff, ie
jeremy yeah
jeremy jblock@theladders.com / test123
jeremy it worked in my ubuntu vm , but not my host and not my win8 vm
jeremy i have no idea
jeremy does that sign-in work for you
jeremy ?
jeremy cleared
jeremy or at least i told chrome to clear them
jeremy closed all chrome windows
jeremy killed all chrome processes
jeremy could uninstall / reinstall but that seems like overkill
jeremy haha
jeremy nope
jeremy disabled plugins, no change
jeremy do you have a windows vm?
jeremy works in ubuntu but not win7 or win8 vm
jeremy nope
jeremy now it is working
jeremy find anything useful out about http/https ?
jeremy rest of the cards look adequate. there's not a lot there

#koala < gwong> aturley jeremy
dgrove my notes on salestracker:
dgrove fucking snowflakes:
dgrove salestracker1 / salestracker2  -talk to andy
gwong i am going to tag it now
gwong so it would be
gwong hg -f NEW_LW_20130411_01 ?
gwong hg tag -f NEW_LW_20130411
gwong ok
gwong hahaha
gwong -f is for frontend only ?
gwong what about fighting-narwhals
garywong everything looks good
garywong can i deploy to staging ?
jeremy someone is selling grep for windows for $159
#team-chaos-monkey < s> aturley hit that one early
gwong thanks
gwong it's weird
gwong i can be able to connect to he db from command line
gwong but not the gui tool
gwong i use sequel pro and it works
gwong which table do you want me mainly focusing on ?
gwong ok
gwong ok
gwong career history is now the highest priority ?
gwong ok
gwong ok
mattjanks I like the alias aturley@theladders.com
mattjanks Just personal preference though...
jeremy I am full of pancakes.  Any progress on job matches or career history?
jeremy is The Man coming after you?
jeremy Then the government says "I bet you're a rich person pretending to be not rich" and starts skewering you?
jeremy haha
jeremy I made $10 from interest and had to fill out another form.  Wouldn've known but the bank sent me a thing about it
jeremy FREEDOM
jeremy People who elect people who think government can't do anything right deserve what they get.  Unfortunately the rest of us suffer, too.  #makingAssumptionsAboutYourPolitics
jeremy haha
jeremy One of the problems is probably the fundamental disagreement on what government should do and how it should do it
jeremy (swearing)  The password reset link was wrong in the release
jeremy probably clicked on it, saw that it went to the pw reset page, didn't notice that it was pointing at QA instead of Staging
jeremy Fortunately almost no one hits that page, so
gwong another quick question
gwong whenever i do tagging
gwong if i don't make changes on webapp
gwong d
gwong do i still have to tag web app ?
jeremy (4:12:54 PM) gwong: should we make a build on QA-1 as well ?
jeremy (4:15:23 PM) jeremy: let's see if we can get andy's change on qa-1 at the same time instead of deploying to it twice?
jeremy (4:15:50 PM) gwong: sounds good
jeremy (4:16:00 PM) gwong: so i will just wait ?
jeremy How close are you to 'ready to deploy to qa' ?
jeremy So where did we leave off on Friday? Staging deploy not working?
dgrove is it ok to reboot salestracker1 right now?
dgrove cool
dgrove done
dgrove you may want to check on it
dgrove isn't that the backup node?
jeremy pw reset link still QA on staging
jeremy shitballs, like all good swears, functions as either a noun or verb
dgrove that's fine
dgrove it's your head, not mine, that they'll want to stick on a pitchfork 
jeremy he's looking at it
gwong  sorry andy i wasn't be careful enough
gwong i always forget to do push after i tag it
gwong it's on QA
gwong let me deploy to staging now
john btw
john I was  looking into those tmp files a little while ago
john looks like a result of resume parsing?
john ran strings /tmp/rep3015324894457155421tmp etc and it looks like resume data to me
john I dug around in fighting-narwhals for the offending code but couldn't find it
john but yeah
john http://paste:8080/paste?c=7q6l0
john resume related
#migration < kwinter> aturley said it's already been fixed
jeremy http://member.theladders.com/login
kwinter you think you can fix the Maybe$NoValue error we're getting for resume critiques?
kwinter ok sweet
jeremy hi
jeremy i query tribeca 
jeremy port 3306
jeremy i have a user name and password (saved, don't know it)
jeremy there's also tribeca readonly
jeremy readonly/madison i think works
jeremy You can also query bisql02 if you just want data and don't care that it's a day old
jeremy readonly / madison worked for me
jeremy hostname: tribeca. port 3306
jeremy hm
jeremy i cant see ladders db in there
jeremy just test and test_slave
jeremy so it "works" in that i can connect
jeremy ask kulc for your credentials to be reset?
jeremy if i connect to tribeca with user jblock everything seems to be working
jeremy yeah
jeremy maybe the user readonly is fucked up
jeremy should we get you some sort of IV ?
jeremy haha
jeremy my train of thought took me to Nethack Conducts... ( http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Conduct #nerd )
jeremy neat
jeremy Going for the pacifist conduct, i see
jeremy history knowledge check: fail
jeremy wouldnt that work better on the french?
jeremy that's very strange
#koala < kwinter> aturley: local curls for login worked on 3&4
john that's it
john next time I think of it
john I'm going to buy a sandwich
john and put it one of the cups in the bathroom on the sink
john it's absurd!
john there are cherry flavored tictacs
john what next, werthers?
john then maybe some mixed nuts?
john then perhaps some caprese salad?
john soon we'll have racks of lamb marrying sous vide steaks
john heh exactly
john mike's executive assistant
john heh
john I was being a little facetious in her title
jeremy Was there going to be a meeting today about how to assign work to individual people on the team?
john she's booking them for 1:1's with mike
jeremy oh, there it is. 330pm
john I guess the HR department here is supposed to be a resource for humans
john so... they're formalizing it by scheduling 1:1's to get feedback, vent, whatever
jeremy Anything I can help with before then?
john I'm speculating, but I think that's it
jeremy salt the earth?
jeremy haha
jeremy service request, service order?
jeremy what's the error?
jeremy place a circle of salt around your desk to keep out evil spirits
jeremy If the evil is already inside the circle I imagine you'd have to take additional steps
jeremy Is there a specific case where you get errors?  Like, a user who never requested a critique does something-something
jeremy perhaps a missing test as well?
jeremy neat
john heh I see the one you're talking about
john hahahaha
jeremy same link doesnt work in staging
jeremy uh oh
jeremy What did you find?
jeremy prod: requires sign in, then works
jeremy probably shouldnt require 2nd sign in, but so it goes
jeremy thanks
jeremy unfamiliar join syntax
jeremy That is only used if a visual critique is not present, right?
jeremy i was confused because for my user it returns something
jeremy also a null rsume writer id
jeremy there are a lot of null resume writer IDs.  Seem to stop on 2012-09-28 though
jeremy I think it's all people who we decided didn't need to buy a resume?
jeremy does jobseeker profile status matter for resume critiques?
john rude question
john what's your rent, ballpark?
john between 2500 and 3k?
john over 3?
john not bad
john sach and I are kicking around the idea of moving to your hood
john even though you want to move the fuck out
john but she's likely going to be showing a lot in your area and across the east side, kips bay, murray hill
john heh yeah
john murray hill is kinda boring
john and a little douchey
jeremy our job feed meeting went off on a tangent about hipsters =/
jeremy So I don't need to worry about if profiles are approved for critiques. cool
jeremy I still see 'request a free resume critique'\

jconnolly team vote?
jconnolly newcomer anti-process usurpers
jconnolly it's difficult to type ctrl/cmd+t
jconnolly we tested some remoting tools when you were in CA
jconnolly nothing made the cut =/
jconnolly I want to revisit it though
jconnolly I like the stakes
jconnolly izzy... lol
jconnolly They should give you a bonus for evangelism. That's a really good write up. The honest view is much appreciated. I've attached my resume.
jconnolly Where do they want to go with their iOS/Native mobile efforts? What I mean by that is, what do they think they can offer with a native mobile app in the context of job searching that can't be done effectively with a mobile web-app? That may sound a little laced with skepticism, but I promise its not. Perhaps we can hit up a round of dranks to talk about it a bit? Anyhow, thanks for passing on the goods.
jconnolly -- Matt
jconnolly Deissig wants me to help him man the table at the New York Startup Job Fair this friday
jconnolly I think I did a reasonably good job at the Boston one
jconnolly sean is completely insane at these things
jconnolly actually that's not fair
jconnolly he's intermittently insane and eloquent and lucid
jconnolly it's a sight to see
jconnolly http://desennapartners.com/
jconnolly so much early momentum
jeremy These are not all the same
jeremy Does "Your resume critique is on its way." mean that a critique was actually done?
jeremy That sounds more like an acknowledgement
jconnolly I think my dad's getting a bit jaded about the state of advertising in the 21st century
jconnolly he just sent me an email saying "This is what we do.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRDhx8Lo37E"
jconnolly that was my reply
jconnolly That is hilarious and a little depressing.
jconnolly A bit jaded about the direction advertising has taken in the 21st century?
jconnolly -John
jconnolly it's not whiskey decanters and cigarettes

exhausto-sean ping
exhausto-sean anyone ever talk to you about team plans?
exhausto-sean drew?
exhausto-sean or maybe john mentioned because i told him
exhausto-sean and was going to talk to you and just got lost in the shit storm
jconnolly also, beward the attractive, insane african american woman who frequents Ant and flirts with young men very very drunkenly
jconnolly apparently that's a thing
exhausto-sean ok
exhausto-sean yes
exhausto-sean so
jconnolly I didn't know it, and having a younger sister, tend to get a little protective and tried to press her into calling a cab and getting home safely... until the bartender and doug told me it's a thing and to just give up, it happens almost every night
exhausto-sean  the cyrus guys are starting over there
exhausto-sean once they are up and running
exhausto-sean the decision will be
jconnolly weird night
exhausto-sean are they up and running enough to bring dexter along when he gets done with bootcamp
exhausto-sean if yes, then you are back on platform in about 3 weeks
exhausto-sean if not, up to 5 weeks
exhausto-sean after that 
exhausto-sean the plan is we dont flop people around from team to team anymore
exhausto-sean that you for pitching in where stuff needed to get done
exhausto-sean interesting how?
exhausto-sean o yes
exhausto-sean indeed
exhausto-sean if all goes well
exhausto-sean there will be 2 andrews on platform
exhausto-sean he has about 17 years experience
exhausto-sean currently working at google
tk1 how does this movie thing work?
tk1 its screening at 1pm and 10pm or?
tk1 Dune studioe?!??  I want some spice, yo!
tk1 right 
tk1 maybe it will help take the edge off.
tk1 but it sounds like an installation actually
jeremy Do we use subscription_payment for resume critique/purchase CTA stuff?
jeremy a query from ken for something else has 
jeremy and spm.payment_type            not in (2,3) /* bought resume */
jconnolly oh jesus
jeremy that doesnt .. make the comment make sense
jeremy forwarded you the email for context
jeremy also outlook autocomplete helpfully suggested Alex Douzet
jconnolly that's the spirit!
jeremy i saw him walkk by with what looked like lunch
jeremy haha
jeremy What did we need to ask him again?
jeremy We weren't sure about ... something.  Buy without critique?  Think that's the add user - send bill process
jeremy that's heartening
jeremy the 'heartening' was code for 'not very encouraging'
jeremy sounds pretty simple when explained like that
jeremy unless there are still services that arent resumes that look like resumes
jeremy Who knows what we'll be selling in a year
jeremy i see you've played knife-y spoon-y before
jconnolly which one is cassidy again?
jconnolly now I'm curious
jconnolly how'd that go?
jconnolly oh
jconnolly well then.
jconnolly *phew*
jconnolly start by changing the password for mysql on varick.laddersoffice.com to something other than stre$$
jconnolly haha
jconnolly you do seriously hate that bathroom.
jconnolly wow really?
jconnolly I wish we all moved to 205 when we closed 205.
jconnolly that looked like a building that respects its employees.
jconnolly just to bring some papers outlining our open positions, where to find out more about the team, urls for github.  something to take away with them.

jeremy good morning.  how was the weekend?
tk1 i miss trello already:)
tk1 did you go to this installation on friday?
tk1 well 
tk1 i think we may have anxiety
tk1 in the end if we feel empathy for machines, this may over complicate our already overcomplicated relationships with them.
tk1 but parameciums on the other hand
tk1 ah yes
tk1 was there free gin?
tk1 totally
tk1 except i feel comfortable with them...perhaps because they are less of a threat.
tk1 ha. i love alcoholic branding events. fru fru always fru fru
tk1 you did not go to gergen's party?
tk1 hmm. i felt lawful.
tk1 naw i understand. i'm a square. i more often than not stya in on Fridays
tk1 i hear ya.
tk1 how are things on resume?
tk1 everything okay over there? 
tk1 hmmm. :/
tk1 well there was a push to get it out.
tk1 some unexpected issues with sales tracker etc.
tk1 right?  unfortunatley you are tasked with clean up .
tk1 yuck
tk1 that's no fun.
tk1 but that's what i'm doing on LW anyway too....
tk1 :)
tk1 oh good.
tk1 trying.:)
tk1 i'm trying to be more 'lean'
tk1 really?
tk1 COOL!!?!?
tk1 i love those shitty discount electronics places too.
tk1 hhahahaaaa
tk1 absolutely
tk1 aha. not a bad idea.
tk1 you should get a raspberry pi though and play with it.
tk1 i think you'd enjoy it.
tk1 are you going to fabricate something?
tk1 ooo we should go to that lighting store too sometime!
tk1 hahaaa
tk1 ya!  i haven't been yet
tk1 they may have some LED rope i can buy for a project i may never actually do
tk1 hhHHHHaaa
tk1 okay so here's the deal. i'm not going to go to the conference.
tk1 but the pi has to be used for something.
tk1 indeed.  right!!!
tk1 i had a bit of an 'its complicated' situation in with a guy in Germany.
tk1 so half the reason i was going to go was to meet up with him in vienna
tk1 but he finally dumpted me.
tk1 naw he's polish
tk1 which makes it even more convoluted.
tk1 but research scientist always floating around and just wasn't inspired enought to actually figure it out.
tk1 right. 
tk1 but thanks.
tk1 maybe we start with something that doesn't have to be mobile.
tk1 ??? or?  hmm...i dunno
tk1 we can brainstorm on the way to the lighting place.
tk1 maybe we can drink on the way too. getting dumped 
tk1 entails lots of alcohol
tk1 intake.
tk1 bleh. anyway. alcohol. yes.
tk1 yup
tk1 or wine in vitawater
tk1 bottles.
tk1 yours too!
tk1 i've done a fair bit of wine drinking in public parks.
tk1 hahahaa.
tk1 well WE aren't robots.
tk1 hahahaa
tk1 good plan.
tk1 responsible !!
tk1 http://learn.adafruit.com/pi-thermal-printer
tk1 here's pi + fabrication or??
tk1 well maybe not so much
tk1 i also was thinking.
tk1 ummm.
tk1 hahhahaa
tk1 i actually really love the wings.
tk1 but no.
tk1 http://www.yelp.com/biz/canal-lighting-and-parts-new-york
tk1 i think this is the one i was thinkgin...
tk1 but 
tk1 exactly!
tk1 http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--8ENWk2GM-s/T0KGAaQFIiI/AAAAAAAABGA/Zn2Rue24zuA/s1600/CanalLightingParts%2B%25281%2Bof%2B1%2529.jpg
tk1 :D
tk1 right??
tk1 http://goo.gl/maps/mGOhP
tk1 jhhhhoooo
tk1 well that's okay.
tk1 the plastics were probably faschinating enough
tk1 don't forget all the crappy electronics
tk1 new york paraphenalia (sp?) and chinese pastries.
tk1 you could ever need.
tk1 what do you think of those new cirrus (sp?) guys?
tk1 hahaaaa
tk1 good good.
tk1 well
tk1 those hired Mercenaries get paid mad $$ 
tk1 they should follow our rules.
tk1 oh really
tk1 recently??
tk1 WHAT
tk1 oh i see.
tk1 that's cool.
tk1 right
tk1 that is the trick isn't it.
tk1 :)
jeremy How's critiqueland coming along?
jeremy sounds promising?
jeremy though that has a "change ST" component, so maybe not
jeremy uh oh
jeremy going to wake up screaming about resumes, probably
jeremy Is there a confluence page with the requirements and rules yet?
jeremy Did you know there's a table vendor_service ?
jeremy now i sit close to you so i can do the awkward "type type type.. look at you" thing

jconnolly wtf
jconnolly DAYS_TILL_NO_RESULT_EMAIL=14
jconnolly not only is that a colloquialism, it's an incorrectly spelled colloquialism property
jconnolly unless it relates to minding the land
jconnolly oh nice, meara and zhen are going
jconnolly This month, we're going to be exploring the fascinating intersection between Big Data and the Internet of Things.
jconnolly --------------------------------------,-----------------------------------
jconnolly the whitebean escarole is really goddamned good today
jconnolly probably used chicken broth though, if I had to bet
jconnolly the sauce is like ragu
jconnolly I made sauce from tomatoes Sunday
jconnolly it was fucking terrible.
jconnolly TIL: never trust an irishman with a nona's job
jconnolly touche
jconnolly trying to find this jsfiddle-like thing I found for d3 the other day.  my chrome browser history says a lot about me.
jconnolly Dmitri 
jconnolly my first day jones was angry.
jconnolly he hates hearing people say things he deems stupid.  it makes him very very angry.
jconnolly I AM CURRENTLY NOT WORKING AND THEREFORE NOT IN A POSITION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PREMIUM SERVICES THEY OFFER TO ACCESS JOBS I AM QUALIFIED FOR.
jconnolly what does that even mean, the last part?
jconnolly ah I get it.
jconnolly tickets: bought
jconnolly I bought two tickets for this... front row Sunday matinee show http://www.orphansonbroadway.com/
jconnolly look at alec baldwin's beautiful Long Island Duckface
jconnolly SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
jconnolly I don't recall, jedahan or theterg probably does
jconnolly awesome
jconnolly （ ﾟДﾟ)ノ[($)]
jconnolly filed away for future use
jconnolly yeah I read about him calling for his release citing lack of evidence
jconnolly guess that was granted eh?
jeremy https://confluence.laddersoffice.com:8443/display/TECH/2.+Linux+Setup+Guide
#koala < ejones> aturley: You may be referring to pick he was working with jfine for the last two days while I was out sick.
tk1 hey!
tk1 tomorrow?
tk1 There is a potential ex-UXy lunch today...although it may or may not happen.
tk1 tomorrow is safe though.
tk1 that okay?
tk1 oh good.
tk1 i'm working on a bit of a cheesy el wire project with a friend...wondering if they have it there... likely no right?
tk1 https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10197
tk1 this woman ..... sylvia heisel
tk1 http://artstech.tumblr.com/post/48708652073/unconference-featured-session-spotlight-how-do
tk1 she's into tyvek material
tk1 we want to make a dress of it.
tk1 and use the elwire below the material
tk1 srry
tk1 use the elwire to make a script underneath the material
tk1 so words with elwire
tk1 will probably look similar to this
tk1 http://artstech.tumblr.com/post/48708652073/unconference-featured-session-spotlight-how-do
tk1 i know
tk1 the tyvek is tough and can take the heat.
tk1 maybe its a concept dress.
tk1 have you seen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sejI4PH-Kd8
tk1 this is true....
tk1 okay so its cheesy dance costumes and its lilypad and apparently accelerometers....but i thought she had a dance pad of some sort.....http://gallery.digi.com/2012/04/01/chance-by-loretta-faveri-after-being-knocked/
tk1 i was wrong...
tk1 i know
tk1 tech is cool - but movement is cheesy...its tough to be interesting on all levels.
tk1 excellent...hmm.....
tk1 okay raspberry pi meetup is now on my radar
tk1 hmmmmm joystick 
tk1 didn't think of that.....
tk1 aluminum foil hack solutions.
tk1 i love it.
tk1 okay we have to get going on one of these.
tk1 too many ideas swimming something has to happen :)
tk1 so would you feed a mic into your computer then? blend it with the switches? maybe?
tk1 that's cool =
tk1 that may take a bit of coordination though.
tk1 with the left leg...
tk1 the right leg has to stay stationary to keep the instrument steady
tk1 but would be worth a shot
jconnolly where's the awesome?  I can't find it
jconnolly come lay on the couch for a little while

jeremy wow
tk1 like
tk1 place your own head on any prehistoric creature?
tk1 QUOTE
tk1 "The Walken Rex was originally thought of by a friend of mine, we are not completely sure where he got the idea from, but it seemed like the perfect thing to build"
tk1 indeed walken mostly appears in classics that inspire such intake
tk1 i appreciate the detail of the spec.  makes me want to give, he must be serious.

tk1 bbq is at noon i think
jeremy i dont believe so. what is it?
jeremy on one iphone? interesting
jeremy i see
jeremy Sounds like this will tell you a lot about your friends
jeremy i like where this is going
jeremy Im pretty sure my friend I play video games with a lot would do well with spaceteam, but I know some of my other friends devolve into "do the. thing.. and. uh.. yeah?" when flustered
sean he was at the startup fair that john and i were at in nyc
sean he's very excited about erlang

jeremy if i hit capslock on the one, it changes the state on the other. i didnt know that worked like that
john lol
jeremy with windows' accessibility options, computer will make different tones when you hit numpad, capslock, scroll lock
jeremy So you could play little songs
jeremy I'm sure someone has some serious work on this kind of project

john heh
john interested in seeing the horrifying results of this query in prod
john select email, count(*) from subscriber GROUP BY email;
john just confirmed that POSTing to the jobseeker service with the identical jobSeekerCreateRequests results in two different entries in the subscriber table
john fml
john select email, count(*) from subscriber where subscribe_date between '01/01/2013 00:00:00.00' and '05/06/2013 00:00:00.00'GROUP BY email;
john terrified of what that's going to return
john now that was over the entirety of our subscribers
john I limited it to those who created an account since 01/01/2013
john *phew*
john there are no actual instances of this in prod, AFAICT (so far)
john everyone with a duplicate email in subscriber table has different subscriber_types
john nope
john select count(subscriber_type) from subscriber where email='xxxx@cox.net' AND subscriber_type='S';

tk1 andy
tk1 what is it about devs and their interest in communication via online means
tk1 but have no desire to communicate in person.
tk1 i don't understand this.
tk1 :)
tk1 is there a psychological term for this behavior?
tk1 is that it?
tk1 documentation?
tk1 ha....okay. i guess there is logic building within digital environments.
tk1 okay. i'll buy that.
tk1 right
tk1 perhaps thats why i'm UX
tk1 i'm agile 
tk1 both worlds.
tk1 naw i love people
tk1 but when i communicate with them - then the love disappears.
tk1 :D
tk1 or maybe vice versa.  its all very confusing.
tk1 i know. i know. 
tk1 maybe techies just don't need them as much as we should
tk1 that's it.
tk1 okay too much user analysis lately.
tk1 i'm ordering some mushroom material do you want some?
tk1 http://www.ecovativedesign.com/about-our-materials/core-tech/

jconnolly is the 1-minute rate response times of the jobseeker service for the last 24 hours.
jconnolly in seconds.
jconnolly some people had a very degraded experience
jconnolly our pagerank rating probably dropped a few hundred thousand rungs
tk1 totes i had a big plate of them when i was down there.  but, maybe mushroom beignets may not be so tasty
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: you follow avdi grimm on twitter?
jeremy That is more math than I expected

jeremy i havent used any of the french i studied in a long time
jeremy do you speak any french?
jeremy i have candide in french on my ipad but im not sure im up to that
jeremy i used to text my friend who was also studying french in french
jeremy fun discovery: her phone rendered accented characters wrong. and by wrong I don't mean é -> e, but é -> some other letter of its choosing
jconnolly ugh
jconnolly I know what you mean
jconnolly every time I think I can close the book on the jobseeker-service, it pulls me back in
jconnolly I'm sorry
jconnolly but this is fucking awesome

jconnolly EXCLAIM ALL OF THE THINGS
sean nice
sean cool
jeremy qu'est-ce que c'est, "études for erland" ?
jeremy well, yes, but i was wondering what the connection to ladders was
tk1 this is the speaker from last night: http://www.onelab.org/people-parkes.html
jconnolly you got a minute?
jconnolly I still have no fucking idea why we have a jobreq table and a job table... and where it's appropriate to use either
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: save me the walk
tk1 they wouldn't be so hard if we had siestas.
tk1 we all just need more damn sleep.
tk1 this up for 12 hrs straight business is not right.
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: what do the scots have to do w/ this?  he asked about the irish and the italians
jeremy jblocktest1368733616364@theladders.com
jeremy maybe your work was on another branch and didn't get merged properly? 
jeremy that seems plausible

jconnolly we missed it

jeremy it did accept ۞
jeremy ?
jeremy ?

jeremy i thought you could query staging directly?
jeremy i think it's named something unintuitive
jeremy O.o
jeremy I gather no one noticed until now
jeremy Neat
jeremy So we can probably go ahead with this release
jeremy Did doug say he can fix that problem?
kwinter it's there for a totally bullshit reason
kwinter http://fisheye.laddersoffice.com:8060/changelog/fighting-narwhals?cs=a9ff7425db7bd3425786a4c67e02469154b02c3e
kwinter well, not totally
kwinter it's better than what was there
kwinter but not ideal
kwinter     if (registeredProvider.isSomething())
kwinter     {
kwinter       processFieldsWith(registeredProvider.get());
kwinter     }
kwinter that case though, is something not currently meaningfully supported I don't think
kwinter yea
kwinter but ideally a little simpler
kwinter return resume.otherwiseThrow(new NoDefaultResume(jobseekerId))
kwinter or
kwinter return resume.otherwiseThrow(noResumeFoundFor(jobseekerId))
sean the 'meeting' i just sent you might be of interesst
kwinter yea, so I should have just done that the first time around, instead of making the get
kwinter I was just more focused on "iterator.next()" sucks
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley, you got the number ya?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: crm-tt-ews
jeremy i am sad that my main user's critiqueness is screwed up in qa
jeremy oh, was it more than 6 months old now?
jeremy business ruuuuuules
jeremy Sounds like something I would do and then forget
jeremy hurrah
jeremy upgrade fails wiith a "We can't process this request right now. Please try again later."
jeremy probably not your fault.. wonder what the actual error message is
jeremy {"codes":"payment.failed"}
jeremy Any idea why that would happen now?
jeremy nope
jeremy the RemotePaymentService_java_89 one?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: so thoughts on turning etudes into an evening this and starting over?
jeremy Maybe I should know this, but did you write automated tests to cover these 16 states?
jeremy seems to have worked
jeremy if i missed the first etudes would I gain anything from the 2nd?  Also given that I dont know anything about erlang other than what I picked up from that meetup (eg: not much)
jeremy im trying to fix this email campaign
jeremy css is going to make me cry under the desk
jeremy added another tr, nwo the links aren't links
jeremy but only in chrome

sean tom?
sean i think i'm missing some context here
sean i dont know what any policy is around that
sean lets leave it alone for now
sean and i'll check with kyri about what is cool around that or not
sean how much consumer related stuff you have left?
jeremy i missed erlang but I bested the email thing. except outlook.com
jeremy i hit generate billing url by accident and my user went back to "request a free critique". is that expected?
jeremy i continued touching things and made it worse
jeremy i need to be more scientific
jeremy jblocktest1369752465998@theladders.com
jeremy i voided the bill and now have no critique options on new lw
jeremy Void sounds so much more pleasant and technical
jeremy I did generate billing url, canceled it, then tried to add a new transaction
jeremy Sending a critique to this user made it show up on the site though
jeremy did you commit this on may 24?
jeremy tests look good
john http://osrc.dfm.io/aturley

Drew thanks
Drew it's been a pleasure
john james was next to my desk when I saw it and I exclaimed "oh fucking bullshit"
john speaking of, you ran the meetup last night so I imagine you're not too eager to come out for a beer or two tonight
john I was thinking houston hall but it's too loud and he mumbles
john maybe Emerald?
john too divey?
john oh yeah?
john heh
john let me make tungsten1 less brittle quick then maybe I'll head out
john cool
john well, union station doubletree is all booked up for strangeloop
john so we're out of luck there
john you mind booking something for us?  balances on credit cards are a little high at the moment as sacha is spending more than she's making the last month or so
john no rush

john social etudes for erlang
john John Connolly: Hey we're going to be hosting weekly etudes for erlang meetups in coordination with the erlangnyc meetup soon (starting June 11th) at 175 Varick soon if anyone is interested. http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000726 gonna be fun. I'll post a link to the meetup once information bubbles up there.
john err
john 137 varick
john no prob
john yes, storm shortly
john I'm trying to hide the fact that I overtly copied another topology
john before I check it into mercurial
john peter's topology doesn't use spring which is awesome
john but it's also entirely in scala which is ='(
john there is a clojure dsl
john which I want to use in the future
john but the hammer cometh down on this shit getting done
john so copy I will
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: should say H1B ok
#team-chaos-monkey < peterathome> aturley: remove the reference to clustrix, it's embarrassing enough as it is
jeremy subid  9918940
jeremy seems to work in chrome, not in firefox
jeremy i didnt see anything in splunk except zip code errors
jeremy Where were you digging?
jeremy now splunk shows some null pointer exceptions
jeremy i dont think they are
jeremy since i havent touched it in a few minutes
jeremy but maybe another user is doing something
john okay
john so
john boilerplate nothing is checked in at storm-scout-view
john basically
john I'm going back and forther between storm-pipeline-messages and storm-scout-view and filling things in as they apply to scout
john nothing relating to db access applies, we don't touch the db
john in its place, there are couchbase-related things 
john I'm going to pass the jobseeker-link in the rabbitmq message, this topology will hit the jobseeker-service to populate couchbase with the target salary, education, areas of expertise, years experience, highest degree for that jobseeker.
john yes, that sounds good
john I should have taken a picture of the diagram sean and I created on this whiteboard that's only partially-present now
john maybe we can reason out the diagram again
john those friday forums sometimes give me vertigo
john it gets stuffy and claustrophobic
john I had to leave and splash my face with water and drink something cold or I think I might have fallen backwards
john yeah
john who comes up with this shitbrain ideas?
john subway?
john "the OTWC has really been on it lately.  next week we're all taking a field trip to the Richard Stockton New Jersey Turnpike Rest Stop to learn about the merits of bathroom sex"

john how's it going?  are you looking at the topology stuff?
sean do not disciminate
sean no matter how tempting
sean quiet heathen
john np, just trying to get thoughts on paper, lots of moving parts
john I'm glad I'm not being overburdened with wrapping couchbase at the outset
john didn't know which side of the fence they'd be on that one
john they = peter, sean
tk1 very cool
tk1 developer or UX?
tk1 nice
tk1 totally bad ass
tk1 v cool
tk1 hire her.
tk1 where is she from?
tk1 oh no
tk1 russian?
tk1 oh no.
tk1 oh no.

tk1 ma
tk1 y
tk1 be 
tk1 a
tk1 problem
tk1 hahaaa
tk1 ummmm
tk1 ummmmm.
tk1 maybe
tk1 if problem solver means super controlling
tk1 than yes...
tk1 well - whatever she seems cool.  i'll deal with it.
tk1 gergen's lack of presence 
tk1 i still feel it every day.
tk1 we need a super bad ass woman here again:)
tk1 pfttt
tk1 totally.
tk1 break up the bro energy
tk1 this floor is all pretty bro :D
tk1 :)
tk1 i suppose it could always be worse
tk1 right
tk1 i'm sorry i'm just crabby
tk1 but yes, the numbers aren't as porr as they could be.
tk1 lol
tk1 the other huge problem
tk1 is the lack of humor on Koala.
tk1 this may or may not be a problem attributed to the 'bro' factor.
tk1 i'm hoping the platform team has more fun.
tk1 bravo sean
tk1 bless his heart:)
john nice

john 24 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
john yep no prob
john how'd she know she was tatar?
john she does look pretty bad ass
john fwiw
john cas is what I want
john couchbase has atomic cas
Irina Ok, pick the poster, give me copy and i'll make it
john ah
john (it's tatar and tatarstan ;D)
john hehe. yeah
john yeah that's a kind of blustery introduction
john "here let me throw my hat into the ring, kthxbye"
john so I'm thinking I should at least wrap the couchbase client in a DAO
john am I gold plating?
john or is that reasonable?
john the fuck
john http://www.couchbase.com/autodocs/couchbase-java-client-1.1-dp4/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.html#append(long, java.lang.String, java.lang.Object)
john yep
john doing this: https://gist.github.com/jconnolly/5715873
john cas keeps it atomic
john I don't know yet, I doubt it but I'll be crossing that bridge soon
john hm
john http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-sdk-java-1.1/couchbase-sdk-java-summary-transcoding.html
john ehh
john that's not what I want anyway
john http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-sdk-java-1.1/json-handling-docs.html
john join #storm
john I've got a le question
#storm < john> aturley: probably interests you too
#storm < john> aturley: I just pushed some additions
john hm I think I'd be better off coming in, frankly
john in terms of productivity and ease of communication
john O
john I'm also scheduled to interview Christopher Young
john I already do from what little I know from the erlang meetup
john so
john I'm writing a test for this dao
john not unlike PipelineDaoTest
john which is meaty, uses LDS, etc
john it's probably going to take me some time, but I think it's worth it
john ladders data setup, that clunky dbunit-based utility for getting QA into a integration-testable state
john I have to think about what I want to test =/
john I just started typing something then realized how stupid it was... sorry just thinking aloud
john heh
john > Hello, I am Eliza. 
john * Yo dawg.

john Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: class path resource [qa.couchbase.properties] cannot be opened because it does not exist
john I flirted with similar thoughts before
john then I tried to break the frozen wintry tundra ground with it and broke my pickaxe
john I am so fucking bad at breaking new ground
john I went to hackerschool with the express purpose of getting better at it
john and failed
john that's why rails proliferates
john oh right, I never joined that channel
john rofls
john looks like the coding exercise begins at 10
john so, momentarily I imagine, if he's not here already
john and he's a southpaw
john hired
john fwiw, re 7 langs in 7 months
john John,
john I would suggest then that you start a new meetup group then, as Rich & I have already made plans to move this group forward and cover other languages not covered in the book as well as revisit previous languages in greater depth. We have received a lot support in doing this from current members of the group and these plans were actually announced about a month ago on the mailing list.
john We really do not have an interest in going through the book a second time, as it actually does not go into very much depth about any  particular language.
john Also, this particular meetup group is already being hosted at AOL Path Labs through the month of december.
john Best regards,
john Ray
john Raymond de Lacaze 
john delaray@hotmail.com
john uh oh
john "Chris said he's never written a hash function before, so do I need to do that?" --Mollie
john yeeeaahh
john he's also at AOL/Patch
john which...
john hackerschool was hosted there during my run
john fuck I need to look them up again too then.  all I recall is that they're binary trees with alternating color or somesuch
john I hate interviewing
john I'm just gonna ask what his favorite data structure is and why
john hehe
john favorite algorithm...
john hashmap for me
john and bogosort
john heh
john A* is pretty rad too
john I wrote a javascript implementation in hackerschool
john and it was disgusting
john but interesting
john http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/james-somers-web-developer-money/
john I both identify with and hate this post
john I'm about to read the comments
john because I don't want to think about how to inject a couchbase client into my Dao just yet
john too late I already hate the world more
john fucking irish people
john I'm about to comment
john annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd disqus login timed out
john fuckit
john me fucking too
john seriously between that post and sailthru I'm starting to get haughty
john and Mike balking at the idea of access to free booze 24-7
john what rock have you been living under, you comfortable cunts?
john couple more months, have theladders match my 401k in september, get my bonus, then I may shop around a little
john after writing some topologies and tuning couchbase a little
john he strikes me as a kid who grew up with a bunch of guidos in north jersey and never really had a problem with that.
john never had a desire to leave it either
john the highlight of his year is the trip he takes to miami with his boyz for some clubbing
john in my darker moments i think we might do better hiring an engineer full time to do just recruiting
john and by recruiting
john I mean actively trying to poach
john I think at this point it's an expected duty for both of us
john which, for my first 8 months or so, I seriously fucking bucked at
john I was a little disappointed in the bullshit runaround I got when I brought you on
john I was told by Caleb, before we knew he was leaving, that I got the full amount when you started.
john Then David Gaspin, after Caleb left, informed me that "Well, Caleb got our policy a bit wrong.  You get half when he starts, half when he makes it to 90 days"
john not
john my
john problem
john fuckyoupayme
john there's probably going to be some further extension of criteria
john "half when the new hire makes it to 90 days, the other when they make it to 180"
john also after taxes it ended up being like 3600 or something.  which, nothing to be done there, but I'm an idiot and forgot that part
john yeah. "You've set my expectations for a payout at X date.  I booked a fucking vacation based on that premise."
john fucking spring... I don't understand you

john we fight about that too
john I'm too imperitive minded, he says
john declarative is totally fine, you shouldn't have to step through every line
john I'm all "if I can't tick through a clock cycle, it doesn't exist"
john that was an embarrassing question
john hm I could see that
john yeah, perhaps governed by solution length
john actually
john we could stub things out

sean-at-home that is true
thomas hi
thomas not sure, it's not really necessary 
thomas yup, and if we were only passed the id, we know what string is associated anyway
thomas yeah we load all that data up front
thomas it would require a little code, but yes we could
thomas yup
thomas yup we have those locally as well
thomas same with disciplines
thomas compensation
thomas no problem
john yeah, ugly
john so
john workExperienceId is also in the jobseekerService representation
john         "workExperienceId" : 5
john just fyi
john compensation id is also just compensationRank, 
john id
john  "compensationRank" : {

#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: x.startswith
john alright
john it's deployed
john but something is fucked up because it's not getting the rabbitmq message

john it appears to be working fine from end to end
john but I'm not seeing what I'd expecting to be seeing when I pump messages into rabbitmq's webui
john which could be a red herring, but I want to make sure
john okay, it's working as i'd expect
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: where the hell did they put the repeat and shuffle buttons on rdio.com ?
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: ah ugh I have a feedly chrome extension that overlays directly over that icon, so I can't click it
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: 2.5 slices per person, with a conservative 60% RSVP-attendance rate? 60% of 51 is roughly 30, giving me 30*2.5 slices, divided by 8 for number of pies... which is 9.375.  So I'll get 7 round pies and two square grandma and we should be good.
john ahhh fuck
john I always never always think of that

john so
john here's one that curls a simple {"x":"y"} which is the payload
john http://paste:8080/paste?c=l53ja

jconnolly we might host this summer's batch of hackerschool
jconnolly WeWork is going under construction July 8th and they're in a bind
jconnolly kyri signed off on it, Tarmi is working out the legal wrinkles
jconnolly heh
jconnolly I think so, but we haven't gone into that much detail yet.
jconnolly yeah, we'd have access to good talks too
jconnolly without having to leave the office
jconnolly which, fuckyea
jconnolly fuckyea
jconnolly Thanks for the intro John! 
jconnolly Hi Tarmi,
jconnolly As John said, we're currently a batch of 80 people and are right down the block at 175 Varick. We'd split the group and host 40 here and 40 at your space for a couple of months, which would give us enough time to tide through construction at WeWork and sign a long term lease.
jconnolly I have to step out for a talk at 5:30. Any chance I can stop by at 4:30 or 5pm for a quick chat? My number is 347-264-2736. 
jconnolly Best, 
jconnolly Sonali

jeremy john just asked about that. let me forward
jeremy i didnt have a smart way of finding them. selected where length was longer than it should've been
jeremy well, selected and ordered by length descending
jconnolly html stripping
jconnolly right?
jconnolly yeah.
jconnolly it does.
jconnolly so did the corrupt values in the db
jconnolly apparently
jconnolly but nobody was smart enough to fix it
jconnolly Any idea why/what part of the service or what kind of character?
jconnolly Sent from my iPhone
jconnolly Friday, July 13, 2012 8:08 PM
jconnolly we got rid of the dead weight and distractions and voila, it became apparent the root cause
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley what are the exceptions?
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: it can't hit job or jobseeker service
#team-chaos-monkey < jconnolly> aturley: job-application-qa-1 is slow but working now
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: that looks like an illegal arg to selectJobApplciation-Inline
mattjanks san fran question for you.

jeremy https://www.lw-qa-1.lb.laddersoffice.net/member/job/658513622
jeremy i broke something?
jeremy scout info doesn't load. not sure if user i applied with was in a bad state, or if unit test jobs are fucked
jeremy other jobs seem ok
jeremy maybe
jeremy should scout view include your own application?
jeremy Is that a state you should be able to get into?
jeremy sent you what i think are the subscriber ids of the people who applied to this job
jeremy Are you seeing anything useful?

#team-chaos-monkey < peter> aturley / john - where should the code for publishing hystrix metrics to graphite live?
jeremy So in qa, is it supposed to update scout if i sign up as basic, apply to a job, then approve the profile?
jeremy that is correct
jeremy if i sign up, approve, then apply, it shows up
jeremy dunno if that means more caching stuff is dead, or what
jeremy job location id 800004979
jeremy subscriber id 7933177, 7933177, 7044000
jeremy something broke my rl user in qa =(
jeremy fixed my rl user
jeremy That whole half of the room vanished
jeremy That caching thing from friday was happening again, also. Sean pushed something to invalidate the cache
jeremy i see 3 people
jeremy but one of them might be you
jeremy i think you applied to it?
jeremy this pains me
jeremy the one that is pending should have become unpending when I approved the user, i think
jeremy think i need to write down the IDs, statuses, and expected results for this
jeremy [picture of civ game tech tree goes here]
jeremy i am pushing buttons
jeremy haha
jeremy oh my
jeremy http://paste:8080/paste?c=h5er5
jeremy also only got the application email for the last one
jeremy and hatch only counts 1 apply
jeremy premium + incomplete = shows in scout
jeremy seems so
jeremy yeah
jeremy I assume it doesnt matter if the application was done on qa1 or qa3
jeremy Sounds reasonable
jeremy All the AFTs and other tests passed, right?
jeremy uh
jeremy huh
jeremy this makes me doubt everything
jeremy it said i hadnt applied to the job
jeremy signed out, signed in, now it says i did. something must've failed
jeremy what a bad experience
dbrown How do you work getting the pizza and beer?
jeremy timing issues like.. timeouts? badly written tests/
dbrown Agreed
dbrown Nice. Sure, why not
dbrown At the Uncubed job fair the Facebook booth had gin
dbrown Cool
dbrown No- it seemed like a bit of an odd choice
jeremy That sounds like an integration test but i may not know what words mean
dbrown But it was free, hence popular
jeremy looking at http://jenkins-qa-1.laddersoffice.com:8080/view/New%20LW/job/New%20LW%20Continuous%20Integration/lastBuild/testReport/ ?
jeremy if i hit build now it should just rerun the tests?
jeremy success

john not really
john just that we're going to be using blue hornet moving forward on job alert and job match emails
john by the time they even get that far we should have a few tracer bullet emails going through them
john so I'm not worried
john the other was that in doing the scout view changes, if somehow product wants to add data that's not there, we insist that it's for "new data coming into the site, not old data already in couchbase"
john which, I said "we've got the script. I'm not worried about adding new data to everything in couchbase... the script is written to populate it with historic data already.  Not worried"
john sure, yeah that's what I figured.  let me see how good it came out.  one min
john it didn't come out very well
#mobile < john> aturley: some place that takes credit cards

peterdm so you can load that file up using auto-config proxy settings in OSX ... (you might have a different SOCKS port to put in the .pac file) -- ... and only idc hosts will route through the proxy.
jeremy what should i expect to see on staging? "No scout information is available" ?

john no worries
john it's not so bad babysitting it
john except when it is
#team-chaos-monkey < jholder> aturley: I think so. Some Builder and Service classes could help with that.

john I announced it in the hackerschool humbug channel
john 2 people came
john I can do that for ya if you like, a little less disrupty
john nope
john there are customFields
john I asked that today... the legacy email system isn't as sophisticated
john the markup language that is
john which ugh
john we should be getting something from adam about the rules and features of the legacy markup language
john lol
john i don't fucking get this dynamic content shit and how it's different from custom fields
john i don't think so
john I think custom  fields are per-email changed.  dynamic content seems so far to be per-segment
john yeah it's referred to with %%variableName%%
john instead of like {$variableName}
john (yes, dollarsign inside the {})
mattjanks Are you able to ssh into authentication-qa-1?
mattjanks No problem.
mattjanks Ok, glad it's not just me then.
mattjanks I kicked off a Jenkins build to see if it was just my machine having issues.
john just saw this sorry
john hey I think I have to skip the meetup tonight, sorry.  I was planning to attend but sacha's feeling like another cyst ruptured so I'm going to keep her company and make sure she's okay
john yeah she's worried about it =/
john anyway doctor tomorrow and hopefully this is the last one
john I haven't had much time to review their documentation much further... so I'm not sure how much value I'll add
john tomorrow?
john unless you think we should just do it today
john no way do it
john I'm considering doing the same for a test transactional email just to make sure I understand how it's working before we move onto the job-match emails
john John,
john It's great to (virtually) meet you. I know us at Couchbase have been filling up your inbox recently but I wanted to know if you would be willing to participate in a Q&A blog with us based on your article? It's pretty simple: I email you some questions and then you respond, I'll edit it, get your approval and post on our site. We do this with users who have cool applications that our community can hopefully learn from ‹ here's an example 
john You can reference anything you want, add links, etc. We'll promote it via social channels so it will generate interest in what you all are doing over there. 
john Let me know what you think when you have a chance.
john Best,
john Baxter

john and also near where my great Aunt Constance and great Uncle Steve lived ;D
john "the irish riviera"
john also, I'm redeploying storm-event-tracking too
john apparently that was also hit by the rabbitmq hatred
john janks noticed
john going to tesia's thing tonight?
john nice
john sacha will know someone more than doug
john who not-so-subtly flirts with her
john heh
john granted, we was a certifiable schizo
john I met her a few times and that shined through quite brightly
john did you know Dave Riess?
john or did he leave before you started?
john ah okay
john then I won't gossip with you =P
john he was like a more socially forward Tergis
john moved on to a management role at Knewton following his terg-like role at Bug
john then was a VP of Engineering at a company called Alphaboost that just recently shuttered
john upwardly mobile little fucker
john heh
john talking to him now, I tried to get him to come here
john he got in touch to ask me to be a reference for a position at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
john he's 'out of the game'
tk1 hey sorry its busy over here until 2
mattjanks john said you might have some insights into how we cache images for new-lw?  we're looking to do something similar for this new recruiter-image-service, and i had a couple questions.
tk1 :)
#team-chaos-monkey < derek> aturley: is the referenced Joe Armstrong talk listed here the one you mentioned? Video out in a couple weeks. http://lambdajam.com/blog/2013/7/15/video-schedule.html
kat hey
kat It looks like you scheduled one of the BPA emails to send once per week
kat Was that intentional?
kat Okay, I already changed it.
kat No problem.
kat Thanks for rescheduling them.
dgrove where's your cohort? 
dgrove heh
dgrove 'sick' eh?
dgrove irish flu?
dgrove he's probably one bitch of a rolling ~4 day hangover 
dgrove most likely 
dgrove i never called me to go to the beach.  =[
dgrove it's ok, i told him i needed to do chores and i couldn't go anyway 
dgrove heh
dgrove i know.\
dgrove i had a mostly productive weekend 
dgrove tidied up the living and kitchen, handled the dirty clothes situation, some other random chores 
dgrove finally got around addressing my failing HD in my home PC
dgrove replaced it w/ a 3TB raid 1 array 
dgrove yup
dgrove heh
dgrove managed to rescue 842G out of 863G
dgrove most importantly, i got 100% of home dirs, photos, and music 
dgrove the only thing lost is movies and tv shows, nothing that i can't just retorrent 
dgrove i could probably make another pass and rescue more, but i'm not sure it's worth the effort 
john do you think it demoralizing for me to talk in irc while not in the office?
john just curious
john or the opposite? or neither?
john drained my ear with some shit I got a year ago when this happened to me before, I'll be in the office
john that's one of the worst feelings, vertigo
john good, I don't want to seem like I'm lording over a channel eating bon-bons on my couch.
john I'll be in the office tomorrow, I meant to say.

john what're you envisioning running the query? a script?
john I haven't thought it that far through yet
john I don't see job alerts yet
john hiring alerts
john sometimes they don't come out until 10+ o'clock though
john and there's nothing backed up in rabbitmq, so I'm not that worried
john sorry, context switch
john yeah, peter was telling me about that
john he wrote that fucker already?

john that would take me two weeks, easy
john I need to clean my apartment. fruit flies in my grill, yet no fruit (that I can see)

tk1 forlorn robots, despondent about their increasing irrelevance...as apparently we are post-digital now.

kwinter hmm, wonder if it's related to the warnings about job_job_function
kwinter that's what I was about to look for
kwinter weird
kwinter it's only started recently, seems to have been since the QA refresh
kwinter wonder if the DB is dropping records, or if it's something in LDS...
kwinter nah
kwinter it creates a job
kwinter each time
kwinter yea that I've seen a bunch of times
kwinter which is just inserting the job's job functions
kwinter damn good question
kwinter that warning has been there for months though
kwinter I really want to overhaul LDS

john - Can you give us an update on where you stand with Job Matches?
john - If all is ready on our end, when do you think you can drop the first job matches data file to BH and then send the first Job Matches message? Just need a rough ETA. 
john Also, regarding the empty string in custom fields. We had a follow up discussion with Adam and this will not function the way we discussed on our last call. We are meeting internally today to discuss other options and will regroup with you afterwards. 
john any thoughts on those?
john Job Matches is... we have an idea of how we're going to have it architected on our end, and we've begun to start with small quantaties of data to do initial testing...
john we should draw out the workflow
john when are you free?
john yup
john well I'm not too scared if all you're doing is reading from the same temp table that we're creating already

john Chris Sanders is a Software Engineer at TheLadders. He spent most of his three years in New York City slaving away on The New York Times' website. When Chris isn't bouncing his pecs or flexing his muscles at the gym, he spends his time building responsive web applications.

john nagging email for bios:
john Just waiting on you now, Ambrish.  Here's the bio I have so far:
john "Ambrish Misra doesn't like to respond to emails. He's timid to a fault and would prefer not to provide a short bio for himself. When not not writing a bio for John, Ambrish is usually napping at his desk."
john =P
john innocuous enough
kat I think most of them are.
kat I think some of them are just some people who don't know how to use their phones.

derek Script with basic error checking. http://paste:8080/paste?c=u7em3
derek Yep, thanks. Ok to run on trep-search and tungsten1 to give it a whirl?
derek Great- then can go ahead and add the cronjob. Preference on location for the script, in the /tungsten/ tree? I thought /tungsten/bin/, which hadn't existed yet
derek Looks like it ran fine on trep-search. Is there a nice way to confirm the process(es) are up normally?
derek Going into puppet for purposes of distribution if the box needs to be rebuilt?
john i just discovered this still exists: http://pigbag.tripod.com/coney/
derek ONLINE
derek Via puppet?
derek OK, will ask about that
derek Where should the source of the script live in version control?

john that's going to change after talking to jasdeep at couchbase
john but whatever, for now that's the way it is

#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley is on a fucking roll
#bh < john> aturley: we have to register fucking smarty tags with their system too?
#bh < john> aturley: http://paste:8080/paste?c=q1u0h
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: do you have anything to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkdqXfasg80 ?
jeremy-vm so when we try to save a user's profile on new lw we get an error, PUT https://www.lw-qa-1.lb.laddersoffice.net/api/me/profile/jobsearch 500 (Server Error).  
jeremy-vm there's a null pointer exception on jobseeker-service-qa 1 http://paste:8080/paste?c=o567v
jeremy-vm probably related?
jholder Oh, do you have a link to that Japanese cover?
jholder Ah, drat.
jholder Well, what's one more online account? : )
jeremy Did you fix that null pointer thing?
jeremy was it fixed?
jeremy because i didnt get an exception
jeremy same user
jeremy new user has it
jeremy is there something that takes time to propagate or something?
jeremy an exception
jeremy hm. but with old user that no longer has exception i had applied to a job
jeremy that may have changed things
jeremy this is weird
jeremy yeah
jeremy seems like if i upload a resume there's not a problem
jeremy jblock1377182877552@theladders.com
jeremy one of them
jeremy it's any new user
#team-chaos-monkey < derek> aturley: but where to issue that?
john which?
john yeah, well it should still fucking work
john according to couchbase
john kyle keeps bringing me the same shit
john if I'm going to be johnny couchbase I need to buff the fuck up on their pretty shitty documentation
#mobile < kat> aturley and john: https://litmus.com/conference/boston-register?utm_campaign=tedc13&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email Convince your boss to send you to this!
john I'm going to work from a couch downstairs
john I'm so done with this week, what do you need help with?
jeremy so
john nada?
jeremy i hear you own franklin now, along with john
john pagination with savedsearch is looking kinda impossible. the client can say "give me all documents with id 1-50" and that can be none, then "50-100" that can be none, then "100-150", that can return 24, then "150-200" that can be 50, then "200-250" that can be none
john for which campaign?
john I can probably find it pretty quickly
john downstairs on 3?
john on the couch by hackerschool?
john ah
john on irc
john Hold for BlueHornet Call - Techical Deployment of Job Matches
john final presentations for hackerschool going on on 3 right now
john join me on the couch
john where are you?
john right
john I'll probably miss you if you come late, I think I'll only be there an hour max.

john heh I basically sent him a drunken email:
john Subject: Thomas
john Hiroko's Place
john err
john Subject: Thomas
john Wants to interview with us again.
john Soon (tomorrow or Monday) and no fuckery.
john My instinct: we won't get him. Lets try like hell.  Email him ASAP.
john If you don't email me by 9 tomorrow ill just do it.
john -John
john he sent an angry defensive email back "how long have you known me? do I bs people?"
john Thursday, August 22, 2013 10:54 PM
john after I got home and had another beer
john haha
john I was polite back, he seemed wounded
john my point was:
john "We identified this guy as the most attractive candidate from this batch of hackerschoolers, so rather than just inviting him in to talk, you throw him at our Application Tracking System to fill out a bunch a of forms? Seems a little bass ackwards, eh?"
john meanwhile
john we have people we're not sure about
john and we just invite them in to talk
john how about putting higher boundaries up for thsoe we're not sure about, and lowering the ones for ones we already know we like
john also I was still sore that he took so fucking long to reach out to Isaacs while he was in the job market
john so I wanted to put a finer point on it, I guess
#team-chaos-monkey < peter> aturley: exactly
sean-at-home its mostly data transformation
sean-at-home i'm thinking in a storm topology
sean-at-home take in saved search ids
sean-at-home and convert them over to new format and save
sean-at-home along the way, taking searches that have a function and turning into the match disciplines
sean-at-home that sort of shit
sean-at-home would be multiple step
sean-at-home like if you have just popular filter A
sean-at-home you would go first
sean-at-home then popular filter B
sean-at-home then popular filters A and B
sean-at-home need to execute on that by middle of september for all searches until we say
sean-at-home these edge cases dont matter
sean-at-home ideally be pumping em out before that
sean-at-home way before
sean-at-home basically yes
sean-at-home storm topo in the background works
sean-at-home well
sean-at-home like i said above
sean-at-home has to be done for everything by middle of september
sean-at-home we get mad props if we are ready pre september 1
sean-at-home we get good props if we are ready to do most first week of september
sean-at-home there's the info
sean-at-home you decide what is best
sean-at-home this is why i say, "dont call me a manager"
sean-at-home only if you say "ok ill do that"
sean-at-home i'll be working on job match stuff
sean-at-home i want to get people saying
sean-at-home "those fuckers deliver early"
sean-at-home not "on time"
sean-at-home but "early"
sean-at-home more awesome we look
sean-at-home the more we will get hires slotted in to join us
sean-at-home the more awesome we can do
sean-at-home so yeah
sean-at-home clojure would be awesome
sean-at-home just keep the goals in site
sean-at-home sight even
sean-at-home and im serious
sean-at-home im happy if we never have any java come out of shit of ours that doesnt have to be reusable by other teams
sean-at-home i dont think anyone on the team wants to write java
sean-at-home so, lets not if we can avoid it
sean-at-home so, you volunteering?
sean-at-home excellent
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: http://www.thomaslahr.com/
Drew https://confluence.laddersoffice.com/display/NLW/Migration+of+Saved+Searches
Drew started notes on the business rules
john heh
john told peter I'd have him pagination by this afternoon
john maybe after that
john yeah I can kinda read scheme
john when I'm not coughing my lungs up. fuck today already.
john spent 45 minutes looking for my phone this morning
john it was on the couch, under the remote control
john I think I'm skipping both meetups I rsvp'd for tonight
john drew is putting bad data into couchbase and it's breaking serialization
john what training are you being sent to soon?
john sean mentioned something but I forgot already
john oh right
john that's pretty rad
john so peter and peter won't be the only people who know anything about search
jeremy should https://franklin-ui.theladders.net:8000/franklin-ui/secure/edit-recipientlist.html?id=1282 use bimailingdatadao?  i tried to send a test email for it and got "nested exception is com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: 'date' is not a recognized built-in function name."
jeremy or should the query be changed?
jeremy oh. hm
jeremy hm. test sql looks the same
jeremy facepalm. looked more carefully at difference between test and production sql.  test sql was wrong in this campaign
daniel would you be interested in going to this?
daniel http://www.japansociety.org/event/the-delights-of-craft-beer-japanese-cuisine

tk1 hey andy
tk1 you know that blonde woman in BI
tk1 do you remember her name?
tk1 okay got it  - its crystal
#team-chaos-monkey < peter> aturley: since I know how much you love java… you have to see the beautiful cascading tap I wrote to echo 1 tuple. the purpose of this tap is echo a value given to it just one time.
tk1 np
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: i will need to know the queue name
tk1 srry sean was being a dick there for a second...so you should stop if you need to.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: this is your queue migrate.savedsearches.fo
sean we can do more clojure in general
sean good for data shaping shit
john god help me if you know what i was doing right now

john still there?
john been spying on your listening habits
john saw that you'd been listening to it, but wasn't in the mood yesterday
john more my speed today i think
john how'd it go last night?
john by the look of csanders' 11:35pm tweet looks like you were here late
john anything I can help with?
john dusted off the little schemer last night and flipped through until about 1am
john heh
john i believe that
john most of the fun I've had bending scala to my imperitive will has been with interop
john apparently they should be serializable, i dug around reading yesterday
john yeah
john symbols?
john heh
john god damn
john shotgun
john good tune
john DB Cooper designed Enums
john try to get it deployed?
john the wordcount example based on the clojure dsl?
john cool I can give that a shot
john I intermittently go from horrified to pretty impressed at couchbase's performance
john also
john I'm going to write some utils for you
john doing things async with couchbase, like in the case of this migration
john like 4 orders of magnitude faster than doing things sync, as in the case of the client
john yup
john i used it to get like 3M documents into couchbase in like an hour
john heh...
john okay let me muck about with the wordcount example. I'm going to jump right to staging... right now qa is actually in use
john staging is a wasteland, I can muck about at will there
john haha
john what happens when polo gets it between her paws and rips the living shit out of it?
john tes would make quick work of that fucking thing
john guess why it's a cat's meow
john still worth it.
john just bought the 4th carpet in 18 months since getting Tes

#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: well....
john uhhh
Drew yo
Drew update your copy of legacy-location
Drew and you can run mvn clean package
Drew and get a working jar
john which one is this?
john the funny part
john is they spend the last two weeks polishing up on all those things
john not full time, but like all of them do mock interviews, read and review resumes, whiteboard, etc
john I guess it'd be hard for me to tell my fellow hackerschooler "hey, so your leukemia, not so interesting to employers. might wanna omit that."
john he is a fucking diva
john I don't know, rubbed me diva-ish
john even if it is true that our ATS is from like 2003, philosophically and process-wise
john i could also have just mis-read him
john the way i mis-read kyle initially as being kind of a pompous diva
john it's just his manner of speaking, he's totally not. and again, I didn't sit down with Thomas so my opinion should count as 1/20th yours
john yep
john sure
john cool, I'll give it a shot
john yeah it's trying to pull ladders-core from central and failing =/
john i'll dig in
john cool
john leinengnen is so quiet
john it's like the opposite of maven
john comes from the yiddish for "one who understands"
john damn bro 47M script eh?
john so
john adding [com.theladders/location-parse "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]
john works... lein repl and printing my classpath shows it on the classpath
john but imports are failing which wat
john com/theladders/lw/legacy/location/Location.class
john user=> (import 'com.theladders.lw.legacy.location.Location')
john ClassNotFoundException com.theladders.lw.legacy.location.Location'  java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run (URLClassLoader.java:366)

daniel I'll be in fishbowl for a meeting. Just come and get me when it's my turn.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley, what did that fuckwad pg do this time?
john so here's some really crude clojure for getting location:
john http://paste:8080/paste?c=93pek
john I don't know about that location.userInput shit though
john that looks like custom_job_search.name to me
john heh
john where's drew hiding?
john I gotta know what the keywords are for Sac Jobs
john what's the query for that?
john limit 10?
john limit 7?
john limit 6?

mattjanks Product guy.  Tim.
derek-in-training Erlang Solutions said that we can send 5 or so people, and that's about how many replied to my question a while back about who's interested. Not sure if we can have more use the 100% discount code (you used that?) but I can ask
derek-in-training Don't include the code, though, for now
derek-in-training Monika said sure, more people can use the code. I don't know if they'll get badges and stuff, but can register
derek-in-training Yep
mattjanks hah.
mattjanks not sure.
mattjanks let's try
john-at-home how goes bh?
john-at-home I'm slogging along unifying hatch's use of amqp-client into one big hairball
john-at-home so your clojure script takes a csv
john-at-home it's cool, it's actually only one column so it doesn't matter
john-at-home no delimiter but \n needed
derek-in-training Was my Keep Calm and Code Erlang sign in the elevator when you came in this morning? Was gone when I went out at lunch.

#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: ok, just try to get derek ramped up enough that either he and john can both potentially step in while you are away.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: if she cant get time off within the next 4 weeks, just take like a friday and monday for now to get a little decompress and then do a longer one later

jeremy There's a newsletter that is like "Top recruiters in your DMA"
jeremy I don't really know what happens on the back end
jeremy Kat helped last time, I think
jeremy but then I can't pretend like i'm a super efficient multitasker !
jeremy https://confluence.laddersoffice.com:8443/display/TECH/Monday+Newsletter+Data+Runbook may be of interest
laura sure that sounds great
laura thanks andy!
laura we might make an offer to a biostatistics post doc
laura so there is a good chance your friend is a good fit too

john （　ﾟ Дﾟ)ノ[ ($) ]
john or somewhere thereabouts
john love the russian "D" in there for the mouth.
jeremy So there's the list from zhen
jeremy so for an anti-theist, your email address is a rich resource (i am not an anti-theist, but such a thing was needed for the joke)
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: my regex: ^jobs-(\d{8})(-\d+)?
jeremy ?
jeremy aturley.getStatus(AwfulThings.FRANKLIN);
jeremy If it makes you feel better, windows8 almost made me rage vomit
jeremy the default handling of images is possibly the worst thing i could come up with
daniel should be on confluence
daniel basically it's kill the processes
daniel cd /web/apps/franklin/work/
daniel run stage-release.sh (with the proper tag)
daniel and watch the output logs for funkiness
daniel yes, I would tag them all
jeremy hah
jeremy You hit deploy?
jeremy working on the other email thing i have to do
jeremy so if anything is broken, I might see it pretty quickly
jeremy yep
jeremy franklin doesnt believe in fancy things like syntax highlighting
jeremy You want me to redefine html and css ?
jeremy needs more pop
jeremy kids like pop
jeremy haha
jeremy meanwhile, i dont know why some of this stuff was done in this template, so ill just hack things out until it looks nice in chrome
jeremy http://i.imgur.com/wP9bTP5.gif
jeremy resending the last one of this type puts all the pictures and recruiters in
jeremy so that's a good sign
jeremy there are jobs there.
jeremy haha
jeremy is that the one about the sweater?
jeremy i only know it because someone covered it on the AV Club Undercover series
jeremy if you like watching bands cover other bands, you should check that out
jeremy look at this awful thing i did in the subject last time
jeremy <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %><c:choose><c:when test="${isGeneric}"><c:set var="inDmaName" value=" "/></c:when><c:otherwise><c:set var="inDmaName" value=" in ${location} "/></c:otherwise></c:choose>Employers hiring${inDmaName}for April 2013
jeremy haha. i am glad it has your approval
jeremy I intentionally avoided saying something else that would've made you feel old, too
jeremy Did I tell you about the band Screaming Females?  Not a lot of actual screaming, only one female.  One of my favorite bands of late, and they did a cover for the av club, too
jeremy So... when ken or dmitri does some magic, this email will have the new data and I don't need to change anything (other than the image url)
jeremy this recruiter image runbook is missing some information
jeremy MachinesMachine NameTypeTBDTBD
jeremy im afraid im not familiar with that one
jeremy there is the "on hands and knees in pain" one:           orz
jeremy well i needed to find that end point
jeremy why is your link so long?

jeremy because the last time i did 
jeremy <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %><c:choose><c:when test="${isGeneric}"><c:set var="inDmaName" value=" "/></c:when><c:otherwise><c:set var="inDmaName" value=" in ${location} "/></c:otherwise></c:choose>Employers hiring${inDmaName}for April 2013
jeremy and i dont know how that works
jeremy does this need a change to the recipient list in franklin?
kulc1 temp_nl_job_info
kulc1 populated too
jeremy all the data?
jeremy so i can hit 'go' on this and it should work
jeremy i pushed the button
jeremy got some broken images
jeremy also some missing jobs
jeremy           Steve   Bell
jeremy   Director of   Corporate Sourcing & Research at The Premier Group         
jeremy no jobs

jeremy because i fixed a problem and it is not fixed
jeremy i got a different set of people this time

john is sean there?
john i asked to wfh, and am still home, but I didn't want to be super presumptuous and just stay here.
john as much as I resisted I've got my folks coming by later
john current status: http://www.rdio.com/artist/Sonic_Youth/album/Washing_Machine/track/The_Diamond_Sea/
john one does not simply "turn 33"
john bro did you just throw thurston moore into dad rock?
john I best not be coming into the office.
john yeah it was pretty good. Sach and I met for half-assed sunnyside cocktails, I got a box-set of Monty Python, braised short-ribs and rosemary-parsnip mashed potatoes, some decent petite sirah, early night. Sach wanted to make eggs this morning so I threw my hands up in a "oh I should just work from home today" kind of approval.
john what're your plans?
john also I finished most of my shit for ES for jobs. I know I need to move on to create an indexer for jobseekers but I have a feeling that's not going to happen today or rather until I have peter access.
john so if you need something lmk. otherwise I'm buffing up on prodopsy shit like puppeting graphite so I can federate its storage.
jeremy emailed marc. no response as of yet
jeremy if he doesnt respond or responds with "im not going to review this" then i think we're mostly done
john I like kensington that way too.
john but I still think if I got caught in a blind alley he'd push me in front of him when the knife came out.
john where the fuck is he from again?
john right.
john My nana is from Vermont. a totally push-you-in-front-of-the-knife type.
john in terms of who we interview, or whether our recruiters are any good?
john black tie, no +1
john who fucking does that?
jeremy is that a house?
jeremy gah
jeremy haha wow
jeremy Too bad you can't make a blog about this
jeremy probably not, but jira lets you do things anonymously in some cases
jeremy holy shit
jeremy that dog
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: that first picture looks like it's from 1976
jeremy haha
jeremy That one got worse the more I looked at it
jeremy marc:   Looks fine to me.  Anything I should notice that's different?  
jeremy You are not excited?
john yeah, what do you think about that?
john my inner greed tells me I should ask for 10k and see what happens.
john we each get $2500 from how I read it.
john he said 5K?
john and now it's 2.5?
john mike said he was going to try to work that as a policy.
john that's as far as I know.
john oh, I missed that.
john yeah.
john that's fucking bullshit.
john retroactive or GTFO
john how many 'options' did you get?
john I'm just curious.
john 7500. off by one order of magnitude.
john yeah you've been working harder than me recently. I'm kind of tuned out.
john I think I needed more than a week. Weaksauce like that.
john whatever I'll tune it back in for a little while.
jeremy why invalidjob.pending https://www.lw-qa-1.lb.laddersoffice.net/api/jobs/799993746?_=1381508887119
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: conclave?
sean keeping all the repos in dropbox is a boon for me
sean sssshhhhhh 
sean dont tell legal
kulc1 good morning, we using this table "blue_hornet_email_bounce" for anything?
kulc1 really, odd. I doubt, cause it only existed in QA. Noticed from Dmitri's QA resresh.
kulc1 probably not used.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: what happens in that top recruiters by dma if the user has no dma?
#migration < jeremy> aturley: tracking millions of ganks?  Does "to gank" mean something other than "murder, especially with odds stacked in the murderer's favor" ?
sean tram
sean team
sean you, me, john, derek, peer
sean give the 2 matts 1
sean moar!
sean peter is back tomorrow
jeremy i think i hate images 
jeremy yes
jeremy command line forever
jeremy what does "graven" mean
jeremy every once in a while i come across a prefabricated phrase and I realize I don't know what all the components mean or how they work
jeremy Ok, so I have a bunch of IDs and I need the photos that go with them.
jeremy Why couldnt we use the image service last time?
jeremy possibly because excel sucks
jeremy it can read tables from websites
jeremy so you could, like, run your script, have it generate an html table, host it on your machine, and have excel read that
jeremy but that is a lot of work
jeremy microsoft has a lot of that, i think
jeremy Did you have a smarter way of generating the html tables than concatenating all the constants and values from the provided excel data?
jeremy do what/
jeremy the catting was already done
jeremy con cat buys his tickets ahead of time
jeremy i knew eventually i'd make you throw an exception
jeremy Also ... how do we debutt the list?
jeremy uh oh
jeremy alex didnt like the newsletter
john yup
jeremy dun dun DUNNN
jeremy are you any good at excel? this is a different format than last time (and the time before)
jeremy im not sure i have the authority to ask you for more help on this, actually
jeremy the data from alex/whoever
jeremy instead of one row with 3 jobs per recruiter, it's one table 
john fucking blue hornet. you want me to take a stab at redoing that email with divs instead of tables?
john he'll be beaten to death in jail within a month and nobody will remember his name.
john like what's his name in Ohio who may have auto-erotic-asphyxiated himself, or hung himself, depending on who you ask.
john haha
john so are you settling for the ladders provided vegetarian jambalaya or are we taking you out for lunch?
john and by we so far I mean me
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: you're roped in now
john help I'm falling down the rabbithole: http://paste:8080/paste?c=sntcu
john I did, I found a way out.
john he doesn't own much of that company anymore as far as I know
john he got pushed out.
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: we already have one 
john banksy joke I was saying I'd find while we were at lunch: https://twitter.com/virgiltexas/status/389764841222991872
sean what'd kyri want?
john what was that with kyri?
john are those release emails automated?
john I don't think I've ever released franklin.
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley is releasing dgrove

john the 2500k vs 5?
john no response from mike.

sean i am glad to hear this has been happening in some fashion
sean ive been hammering away on this for a while
sean so nice of them to tell me they started doing it
sean that is more than they were saying before
sean well
sean you kinda did
sean ya ya
sean anyway
sean im trying to get it to something more than that
sean but its a fucking battle
sean im not but its a start
sean anyway good
sean im glad to know something has moved on that
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: are those new headphones birthday presents? or have i just not noticed your fanciness?
john i think it may, let me check.
john now I'm curious.
john they don't.
john we don't, anyway.
john litmus may have it, but we don't give a shit.
john um
john pdm just stopped me to tell me: "my daughter is now the proud owner of a pair of hand-me-down applebottom jeans"
john i don't ever recall discussing either his daughter or applebottom jeans with him.
john that doesn't mean it didn't happen, but absent context that's a pretty awkward thing to share.
john ah
john I wasn't listening closely enough to catch the applebottom jeans.
john red and blue jeans and your white at night things, friend.
john every dickies jacket I've owned I've lost at a show.
john they couldn't tell 'em apart.
john sounds like almost as much fun as me wrestling with a pom to get job-service up to scala 2.10

john Tests run: 102, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
john oh snap that's new too
john what the hell is going on
john sounds exactly the same
john maybe a little less sprightly
jeremy i wish i was good at shell scripting
jeremy i dont know that song and i probably dont want to
jeremy though it cant be worse than i imagine
jeremy fractal trainwreck?
john oh sweet lord
john oh my god
john this is actually a good soundtrack for going through and explicitly ecluding transitive dependencies that are fucking up my beans
jeremy Are you having some sort of midlife crisis with your music?
jeremy also realized i just said a few lines intended to you to another friend.  Let's see if he notices the context switch
john it's the texas swagger that gives it its power
jeremy having trouble because windows' default shell sucks
jeremy i have the 20 recruiters
jeremy i probably have their photos
jeremy the command terminal thinger
jeremy i dont know what they call it
jeremy i wanted to move their photos to some other folder 
jeremy ah, apparently right click is paste
jeremy how completely like all other windows conventions
jeremy it also hits enter when pasting
jeremy sometimes
jeremy anyway
jeremy got a smarter way to get these 20 pictures isolated?
john also
john mvn dependency:analyze and mvn dependency:tree might just save your life one day.
john my so called life
john i'll be rickie!

jeremy maybe because i read 'this book is full of spiders', and, well, spiders
jeremy or both
jeremy haha
jeremy do you know how to get things onto cdn? i already forgot. put into creative project, commit, push?
jeremy so i run http://jenkins-qa-1.laddersoffice.com:8080/view/Creative/job/Newsletter%20and%20Email%20Content%20-%20Production%20Deploy/ to get those pictures on the cdn?
jeremy he seems to have escaped from his desk
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: 9 bucks?  you got robbed 
jeremy uhh where are these images on nfs again?
jeremy haha
jeremy janks reminded me where they are
jeremy now i cant remember how to copy it from nfs to local machine
jeremy something isnt set up right.  "ssh_exchange_identification: connection closed by remote host"
jeremy im stuck in some sort of where's waldo hell
jeremy i have 21 images here, but 19 in the newsletter
jeremy which one of these assholes is missing
jeremy im not sure what happened but i think there's 20 now
jeremy also i think there's more women than men
jeremy i did not. that's really interesting. do you have a link?
jeremy though in this case my perception may also have been colored because the first 4 were women for corporate, followed by another 4.
jeremy so if tmurphy doesnt want me to change anything what do i have to do for BH?

john it's been super easy so far
john the 220K emails... is that because of the new  matching algorithm? did something break?

kulc1 Any issues from newsletter run? She saw paige's calendar event?
kulc1 regarding QA meeint?
kulc1 meeting
kulc1 shit happens
kulc1 still a good run overall
kulc1 :)
kulc1 one of the downfalls to aigle dev
kulc1 can't cover everythings
kulc1 thought you meant me for second
kulc1 ha
kulc1 sounds like too many avenues to go ary
kulc1 ha, was thinking the same:)
kulc1 ya, first few iterations always like that
kulc1 never been on a project that was 100% perfect
kulc1 nope?
kulc1 uh oh
kulc1 oh
kulc1 thought you meant bh stuff
kulc1 actually, job matches that get sent to me are pretty bad
kulc1 oh i see
kulc1 ah
kulc1 ya, that doesn't sound fun
kulc1 hmmm
kulc1 let me know what i can do
kulc1 both I think
kulc1 adding the bluehornet table, made the SQL run longer
kulc1 ended up removing the force index
kulc1 long running sql no good for franklin i guess
kulc1 i ran it last week and it was longer, but didn't think that would negatively impact franklin
kulc1 yep
kulc1 shouldn't happen again
kulc1 that franklin is waaaay to sensative
kulc1 ladders resources?
kulc1 600,000 dollary-doo's will make people very committed

jeremy More like "I am the embodiment of contempt"
jeremy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MJgKDYk5zQ
jeremy I'm sure my cats would get up to even worse things if they could stand
jeremy Also cats walking around upright would trigger something like the uncanny valley.  The "nope nope nope nope" response in my brain
jeremy i have a pretty good bond with the one cat
jeremy the one that i squirt gunned, not so much
jeremy the classic http://static.fjcdn.com/gifs/Nope+nope+nope_0d2f84_4710349.gif

#team-chaos-monkey < joydip> aturley do you know this : http://phys.org/news194539934.html
jeremy what % is bh this week?
jeremy =/
jeremy meh. guess that's easier than franklin and recipient list weirdness
jeremy but that means if bh is fucked up, no one gets it
jeremy er, then no one gets the safe version
jeremy need copy from marc, then litmus test it
jeremy nope
jeremy i still have no copy
derek Can you point me to the docs for the xml lib? I'm looking at the bluehornet-litmus, but should make more sense with them. Thanks.
sean_ nicely done
jeremy So how much can we do without any copy?
jeremy marc said he was working on the newsletter
jeremy got the copy
jeremy we had an exchange
jeremy me: "What text do you want to be linked for the blog you mentioned?"
jeremy marc: [url]
jeremy me: "no, i need to know what text you want the user to click on to go there"
jeremy paraphrased
jeremy didnt get an answer
jeremy haste makes waste, andy
jeremy so now it's time for blue hornet i guess
jeremy also was there a url you can hit to convert sid to regular job id
jeremy it's doing that thing where it strips out the style agian

john http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_troops
john i thought they were more bureaucratic about this type of thing... putting you 'on a plan' for 3 months then just pushing you off the plank...
#team-chaos-monkey < derek> aturley- get a 404 from that
derek What do you think about plugin name?
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler> aturley: nitpick time... is it "unserializing" to "deserializing"?
derek Could flip the existing deploy-uberjar to uberjar-deploy
derek Doesn't sound like the existing one is really in use anyway
john ohh sludgy
derek We want to generate a pom.xml and deploy that as well, right? I have that code in.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean_> aturley: yes

derek The topo is using rmq username/pw of send-job-match-emails-via-bluehornet/test123. I created a derek-test queue in qa to play with, but what should I use for the login? That one? Does it matter?
sean how hard is it to segment bh newsletter send by timezone?
sean we're going to need to do that eventually unless they can just send at the correct time based on something that already exists in their system
gwong yep
gwong from SF to LA
sean they dont have something that can handle that?
sean mrbeefy and dan in the beginning kept talking about how BH can send emails at optimum time for user to open

#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley... exception is also an option....
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: its ugly again
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: the blue hornet send script
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: its the subscriber paramter shit in here
kulc uh, checking it out
kulc is this not jobmatch? spr152.parameter_definition_id     = 152   /* JobMatchAlertEmail */
kulc u have any examples from the rumor?
kulc ha, no worries, feeling that way myself these day
kulc so, user 6187652 receieved job match? and shouldn't have correct?
kulc how do u know?
kulc that?
kulc hmm, hard to replication since the test table get cleared out
kulc doesn't suppose there is a place to get that record anywhere?
kulc ya, believe so. checking a couple of things
kulc going to test in qa. Will put some dummy values in the test table. 
kulc keep u posted
kulc confirmed, sql is working. Although, almost had a heart attack due to incomplete data, but that incomplete data also lead me in the direction of that user only set the 152 flag to false at "2013-11-11 15:56:08". Maybe timing has something to do with it?
kulc maybe the use wasn't aware that one needs to manually turn it off. default is always on
kulc any idea what time the complaint was?
kulc i see
kulc as of yesterday, yep
kulc how does that table get populated. the sql u sent only grabs the data, correct?
kulc for sending
kulc I would think we would of heard of other complaints 
kulc ah, i see
kulc doesn't that add extra data to the table, that may not be needed?
kulc ah

#enterprise < jholder> aturley!
john i've got a crippling case of "fuck it i need some time to myself" lately
john it's probably... showing
john sean didn't mention anything in 1:1s though
john and when i get home and sit back and think about it...
john my inferiority complex evaporates when i realize, other than like maybe 5-6 people here... I'm in the most-capable category
john so i stop panicking
john you've lapped me like 3 times since you started, you capable fucker
john i've waffled between scala and clojure
john haha
john well i'm actually going to make a concerted effort to learn me something.. for the first time in a while, and it's clojure
john i think i'll fucking love it
john i liked lisp in college
john i gave that shit up, left it for the hippies
john but now suddenly there's a national resurgence
john states legalizing it
john i actually love rich hickey
john i love how cavalier and dismissive he is
john it drives peter insane but it makes me all warm and tingly
john that's exactly right
john re: having opinions
john ruttenberg is driving me insane
john things like hostname vs fqdn, things like dhcp over static ip
john I'm not a good person to ask "how is your stuff setup?"
john i have to go take a nap
#enterprise < jholder> aturley: Any idea of when Suz should be out of that meeting?
john 12:54 <john> ps aux | grep erl

#growth < john> aturley: when should this go out?
frankm wow..only 10. I could easlily bundle up 20 whoppers without thinking much, and then I could have passed them out to some street beggers, because I'm not eating that crap :-) 
#growth < derek> aturley: cool- not another one.
john hey i believe you're up for on call
john should change the alias
john i think there'd be some SOAP involved to do it
john yeah it's a bit maddening
john that's basically what I've got going on
john well to be fair
john some changes prodops made recently made that a royal pain in the ass
john but it's back to normal now... after i changed all my filters
john i don't understand why i care about indexer-1
john also
john someone on hackerschool email list just sent out a "hey my friends are moving January...  they've got a 2br 2bath on Metropolitan ave at the Graham ave L stop... it's got a backyard, and it's $1900, anyone interested?"
john ME

john where'd you hear it?
john oh jesus. i left the buglabs organization when there was the billing nag
john i don't know
john he's managing the enterprise team now though
john so he outranks me
#growth < joe> aturley: can you take a quick look at the changes and make sure it all looks correct
john like you know when db or prodops email us to let us know db or network issues have been resolved
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: Riba had a 2br in greenpoint for $1500 that was amazeballs. no backyard but right on mcgorlick. she wanted to hand it on to someone she knew because it was a shame to give it up to a stranger...

#bh < jeremy> aturley / paige : what's the deal with this coming monday's newsletter?
john oh i've fucked up with rabbitmq as well
john what'd you learn?
john amqp-client-core is still opaque to me. i learn about it then forget everything i learn within 3 weeks.
john is it escaped or something?
john yes
john a string of json
john i don't understand the distinction of a java string which contains a json string and a java string that contains a json object. like you'd want Map<String, JSONObject> ?
john just a Message containing json
#team-chaos-monkey < peterathome> aturley: 
john i really don't like jruttenberg already
john no, there was one particular day where he was hounding me hounding me hounding me nonstop
john "where do I get rabbitmq source code?"
john etc etc
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: you use clojuredocs?
#growth < joe> aturley: 
john did you just give paige a lesson in agile?
john how'd that meeting go?
john yeah
john the trello tutorial
john the rule on consumer... is that sean is tech lead on the team and drew is like scrummaster...
john sounds like there should be some imposition on growth too
john you'll have to tell me about some of it later.
john or not
john up to you ;D
john marketing managers... managing engineering efforts... 
john i heard him about the "well, they're an email company, shouldn't they be better at this?"
john hey a lesson learned
john well you're pretty good at communicating, so she's getting good insight.
john i'd probably just grumble, lash out, and insist on working from home a few days
john i'm totally falling in love with lispyness
john it just feels so right
john this looks useful for monkeying with rabbitmq http://rubybunny.info/articles/getting_started.html
john for me anyway
john next time i don't know what's happening within an exchange or queue i'm going to use it
#team-chaos-monkey < jpr-at-home> aturley: My son got a ride from a friend. He said that traffic was bad, but provided no details.

#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: http://rabbitmq-qa-1.laddersoffice.net:15672/#/connections
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: why is one client langhor?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: can you kill it off for a minute
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: something is still connected as that bh user
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley, you know?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: sorry what?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: that yours?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: can you unplug johns machines from the network?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley:
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: i restarted one and its fast again
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley start 1 transactional thing
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: one of you transaction email senders
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: 2 hasnt gotten slow
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: yes
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: we talked about that already
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: you were too busy being rage mad 
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: doign other schemes isnt hard
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: its just a scheme
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: then you use the correct decoding scheme
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: why are we talking about this?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley, not jruttenberg
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: that is quite possible
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: what the listener? langhor?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: or storm-rabbitmq ?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: can you change it to connect to rabbitmq-qa-2 and kill it and restart it?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: you keep doing what you do
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley : what queues does that connect to?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley:  rabbitmq-qa.lb.laddersoffice.net
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: i think it was unrelated
john thanks
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley, sean-at-home: just got some non-zero message rates on several queues. Woo hoo!
#team-chaos-monkey < kwinter> aturley: yea, it's the damn robot aliens
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: we never finished our conversation from this morning
kulc Did we send out transactional messages for august?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: no
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: i just asked what it was
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: the exchange is stil there
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: what was it, where'd it go?
kulc ah, that would explain a few things. Thx
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: we never finished the conversation
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: nevermind what?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley isnt that completely different from where we started
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: so it what i said as "why not x"
kulc so I gather this is what you have gotten in the past "socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer"
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: so yeah why not a single test send exchange and queue that people can use, it has like a 15 minute ttl or something
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: much less to maintain. 
kulc awesome
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: which almost never happens whereas all those exchange would live on forever and ever and need to be maintained
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: clean up after what?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: i was talking about your idea for extra exchanges for each topology that creates an email to send
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: why not 1 perm test exchange and test queue and give it a 15 minute ttl
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: same names but with .test at the end?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: did you see the dlx change i made?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: the new single dlx exchange that currently exists is 'dead-letter'
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: and now the jobseeker-application-confirmation-email-builder.failures queue gets failures. which it wasnt before.

daniel hey, can you make it this Friday?
suz hey there 
daniel trying to get a head count
suz how long should I expect to wait after applying before receiving the app conf email?
suz hiya
suz yep
suz ok
suz ok
suz done
suz 6857815 
suz nope
Amig0 hello hello
suz no, I posted it in RL
suz I added a new location in hatch that I used to apply the second time
suz yes
suz Posted on RL -> Approved in Hatch -> Applied 1st time on LW -> Added second location in Hatch -> Applied second time on LW
suz would scout have info on the job location for the 1st application?
suz each time, I was the first applicant (so at the time of applying there wasn't any scoutn into)
suz right, but is the email triggered before or after my info is sent to scout?
suz and if we're concerned with including the 1st applicant's info in the app confirmation email then there is never a 0 state
suz (i.e. a state where there isn't any scout info) ... right?
suz lol, i might be :) just trying to get clarification
suz and wrap my head around this
suz ok
suz ok
suz how so?
suz Hmmm... I don't see how. Every recruiter-posted job is approved in hatch before appearing in the site
suz on*
suz Correction: every recruiter-posted job *except* for the ones we post for them via hatch
suz 6857752 
suz :( i didn't know you were sick
suz that sucks

suz ok

john i'm in location hell
john i don't understand what the hell is going on
john and peter scared the shit out of me with this comment: 
john this may not be as straight forward as I thought. Its' party implemented as I mentioned above and we'll have to start using that unused code as mentioned above. But also we have to figure out what it means for other type of locations (virtual/travel, regions, states, countries, etc)
john other type of locations (virtual/travel, regions, states, countries, etc)
john is banging around in my head
john and echoing
john having hatch do everything that it's doing related to jobs via the db... do via the job-service
john peter's in hatch

john gundel probably knows off the top of his head
john yup
john it's on default, tagged and ready to go
john pushed
john off it goes: http://jenkins-qa-1.laddersoffice.com:8080/view/Old%20Ladders%20Website/job/Old%20LW%20Production%20Deploy/26/console

john 13 minutes each in 3 node batches, with ten nodes
john so around 52 minutes
john started at 9:55 so figure on 10:47 this finishing
john suz gonna go in and manually test after we're all set?
john recruiters should still be getting an email from old lw
john alright it's on uslw10 now, so another 10-15.
john well
john you can release now
john 10 might not be back up yet but nothing is sending job application emails to jobseekers anymore
paige hey 
paige can you please send me a copy of the application confirmation email? i know i have some test sends but i can
paige can't find them in my email and JSSC is asking for it 
paige thank you! 
john so we look good job-application email notification-wise?
john cool
john yeah saw that looking at the topology
john fucking Drew
john "can you look at the integration test compilation issue on default for old-lw?"
john release squid had no problem compiling either
john i think you were CC'd
john me too
john no, don't
john if he nags I'll look but according to gundel that had been an issue on default a few commits before i merged down
john yeah
john exactly
john also, TIL: put bacitracin on gauze before applying to open wound. otherwise it sticks, then when you change it, ouch.
john it'd take my whole eyebrow with it
john or is that the new skrillex look?
john shave one side of your eyebrows?
#growth < joe> aturley: we may not need the # of recruiters
john ah, yeah
john that's my fault
john i renamed it
john there's a setJobseekerEmailSenderEnabled(boolean) now and another method
john I'll fix it
john also this is curious though entirely unrelated: http://goo.gl/DptQL8
john why is job-application-11 so good at GCing, and none of the other nodes perform as well?
john oh
john because it's getting no traffic
john yeah i'll fix it tonight or tomorrow and push
john i'll let him know
jruttenberg thanks
kulc yo, working on half a tank today. Still feel crappy. What's the plan for tomorrow's newsletter?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: is there any reason the job application email creation topology can do requeue on failure?
kulc are we sql'ing for  >= 1 or > 1
#growth < joe> aturley: can you include a couple of <br/> tags at the end of the string
#growth < daniel> aturley, we employed someone one who was semantic

#team-chaos-monkey < derek> aturley- what's needed in ladders user's ~/bin/ to copy over to ~honeybee/bin/? Just bh-ftp.sh? Is that puppetted?
#team-chaos-monkey < derek> aturley- thanks. Just noticed that plain ftp (and ncftp) to ftp1.idc.theladders.com fails for the honeybee user. ncftp fails for ladders user. How are credentials specified for both?

john-at-home i've had it up to here!

john-at-home while I tried to finish job-service and fix a bug i released to prod by EOD
john-at-home i might get a gold tooth just to glint it at him with menace
john-at-home "yeeeeessssssss?"
john-at-home that's my version of "headphone time"
john-at-home "don't fuck with connolly while he's got the grill in"
john-at-home "he's wired in"
john-at-home desenna said that once i think
john-at-home "hang on, I'm wired in"
john-at-home I once had a redmine to build a wall around maurizio with old bug boxes.
john-at-home haha
john-at-home maybe I'm ageist?
john-at-home well, yes
john-at-home fuckers spend an eigth of their income on gambling now, you know that?
john-at-home like, have you not heard of scotch?

john got it
john JohnCLadders
sean-at-home amusing
sean-at-home i find that to be an interesting exemplar in avdi's decent into whining
sean-at-home do you follow him on twitter?
sean-at-home he's been whining up a storm
sean-at-home its gotten worse as 2013 went on
sean-at-home he's become a real whiner this year
sean-at-home i boil david and avdi's conversation down to
sean-at-home "i like OO"
sean-at-home "i dont"
sean-at-home "fp has issues here"
sean-at-home "oop has issues there"
sean-at-home *staring*
sean-at-home his examples exist in OO stuff as well
sean-at-home difficult apis are difficult apis
sean-at-home for someone coming from ruby, its amusing
sean-at-home i think the real fix to those issues is a nice strong type systems like haskell or scala
sean-at-home you can do type safe builders with scala.
john got a minute?
sean-at-home that really solves the problem
sean-at-home oo in ruby doesnt address that
john it's about jobseeker-application-confirmation-email-builder queue and its corresponding failure queue?
sean-at-home smalltalk with keyword args is better than ruby in that regard as well but not as good as scala
sean-at-home i see no difference between ruby and what avdi is complaining about
sean-at-home and given that david's oo is pretty much all ruby
sean-at-home i understand where he is coming from
sean-at-home i don't understand where avdi is coming from given that the subtext to a lot of his tweets etc has been 'i dont have this problem' in ruby
sean-at-home i think avdi has decided that eventually he cant make $ off of ruby anymore
sean-at-home and is looking around for what next
sean-at-home and is feeling pissy about it
sean-at-home that and he's so fucking whiny now
sean-at-home i say so mich
sean-at-home and you say so little
sean-at-home you just humoring me
sean-at-home about?
sean-at-home cool
sean-at-home teach them so they can teach others
sean-at-home ha
sean-at-home i need to learn idris
sean-at-home about what?
sean-at-home i think dynamic languages can work to varying degrees
sean-at-home depending on features
sean-at-home but you need to architect around the tooling and lack of static typing
sean-at-home ive moved on from that
sean-at-home given how hard it is to have vibility into what is going on in a ruby or python or perl program that is 'using oo'
sean-at-home i dont think avdi's argument holds much water
sean-at-home if you did
sean-at-home it was really early on
sean-at-home and i dont remember
sean-at-home because you used objects?
sean-at-home it modified the maps in place?
sean-at-home fun!
sean-at-home all the mappiness of fp
sean-at-home all the mutability of oo
sean-at-home there is a reason that one of the top google searches for me is "The Immutable Sean T Allen"

#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley, john, jruttenberg, derek, pinak et al... make sure you have a computer at home tomorrow in case you cant get in
sean-at-home yes
sean-at-home i can see that
sean-at-home you should write a blog post about this movement towards schemas in clojure and cobol
sean-at-home do you have a blog?
sean-at-home if not, create one or use the ladders blog
sean-at-home its a great topic.
sean-at-home you should do that
sean-at-home and do it soon
sean-at-home cos its timely
sean-at-home basically
sean-at-home you need to get writing
sean-at-home laziness and storm seems like a good ladders blog post if you want to do it there
sean-at-home DOOOOOOOOOO it
john wanna do saigon shack? i'd kill for some pho, and the nyu brats are all away
john should be quiet, though it's a schlep
john gimme 2 mins, brb
derek 1) What's the format of the data portion of the transactional sender json?
derek 2) How to specify that the transactional sender topology should use the STAGING values from configuration.clj?
derek Thanks. Looks like it's using staging regardless of LEIN_JVM_OPTS
derek Cool- sending with that template worked. On to making the wrapping change
derek Did you say that the "legacy" stuff in the transactional sender is unused?
john you listen to this yet? http://www.rdio.com/artist/Pelican/album/Forever_Becoming/
john or did you show that to me?
john that album is delicious
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: you told me it didnt support posting to an exchange w/ a routing key
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley, john, derek : do we want to create a new irc channel for a minute and talk about a cronjob for requeueing the transactional emails?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: well, problem
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: if we requeue those then scout picks them up as well
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: not needed, john releases fix soon.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley john join #cron-it
#cron-it < john> aturley mentioned he thought peter had some way of sending along the number of times it was sent as a header or something with the message
#cron-it < john> aturley ?
#cron-it <@sean-at-home> aturley: not quite, it just goes into a different stream to be retried with a larger timeout

joydip hi andy
joydip sorry didnt see u r here
joydip i needed some help on strom
joydip about scheme
joydip whethere there is any place I can learn abt that
joydip dont scare me
joydip can I bypass clojure to know scheme?
joydip ok basically thsi si what I want to do
joydip I want to use storm-rabbitmq library to read matches data 
joydip from the code examples I have it uses IRichSpout to create the spout
joydip for which it needs a scheme
joydip actally I asked Sean just a moment back
joydip it seems he has an answer as Jsonxyzscheme
joydip but it seemed to me that I can use a very simple scheme
joydip so just wanted to know what other schemes are there etc
joydip from the document in the web, I see only RawScheme and no info on that
joydip can I use RawScheme?
joydip ok great - what module is it part of
joydip i guess it is storm-ladder
joydip ok
joydip great, thx for the info
joydip  i am reading the posts and trying to make sense
joydip no more questions fro the time
joydip thx
joydip when 's' is replaced by 'j' in that word, somehow it looks scary to me :)
joydip good - someday I'll attain that state
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley for the weekend. then back to john on monday then to you when that blows up
sean-at-home hows the recruiter service?
sean-at-home k. we can go over on monday
sean-at-home good luck with on call
sean-at-home things seem to have been relatively quiet
john-at-home thanks
john-at-home been on call for like two weeks
john-at-home and they just now found a bug in hatch with job feeds
john-at-home this moment, that MUST BE FIXED BY MONDAY
sean i would like to apologize in advance if i snap at you or anyone else
jconnolly cool thanks
jconnolly changing on-call over again
jconnolly how was your weekend? besides sloppy lunch/night on saturday?
jconnolly how'd that go?
jconnolly not bad, sach and i did a dinner and a movie date for the first time since like July
jconnolly saw american hustle. christian bale was good. it was an above average movie inflated by star-power though.
john weird interspersions of comic relief
john felt like a mix between goodfellas and blow, trying to be scorsese
john but it was still worth a watch
john looking good
john typo
john I've built up a weath of information
john heh
john I agree about "just"
john use "just fucking"
john I don't think I've used the word "just" with jruttenburg actually
john I use "just" as in "just now"
john according to irclogs
john ah no
john here's a bad one:
john 91:10:52 <john> i just googled it
john i can hear cronyn in this: "Couldn't you just ..." As I thought about it, I came to the
john conclusion that I ask this type of question when I believe that I know
john a better solution to a problem, but I'm not confident enough to
john propose it as an improvement. It's fence sitting, plain and simple. If
john I know that I have a better way of doing things, I should say, "You
john can do X instead of what you're doing," but I'd better be damned sure
john oh really?
john that I'm right, and I'd better phrase it in a way that is constructive
john rather than accusatory.
john nice observation
sean this reads oddly,
sean I haven't thought hard enough about the problem to
sean understand the interactions and repercussions of the proposed
sean change
sean i think i'd break the sentence it is in up into 2 
sean  But I there
sean are still unknowns that I need to research, and probably even some
sean issues that I'm not even aware of yet." <-- i think the second word isnt supposed to be there.
sean Once I've finished a task, I don't have an objection to using "just"
john Hi John, 
john I'm working with the founders at Cooli, a mobile messaging platform, to find a VPE with experience in Erlang, XMPP, MongooseIM, and high trafficking/messaging. 
sean to describe the solution, but usually the solution is interesting
sean enough that I actually want to talk about it in detail to anybody who
sean will listen. <-- should be 2 sentences
john They're in stealth mode right now, with launch planned in a few months. While I can't provide many details here, suffice is to say that Cooli is revolutionizing the way we communicate and is not "yet-another-messaging-app". They're closing on a $2MM seed round ($10MM valuation) in the next month or so. This is an interesting, high energy team building an amazing product.
john Let me know if you'd like to connect with the founders and find out more. 
john Matt Somero | Technical Recruiter | Quest Groups LLC
sean If I'm using "just" to describe a solution then I'm
sean there's a chance that I'm getting bored. <-- 2nd I'm shouldnt be there
sean "I've built up a weath" <== wealth not weath
sean "I've built up a weath of information about this domain that allows me
sean to know that this particular problem can be solved by changing that
sean particular constant, and there's nothing simple about getting to that
sean point." <-- i'd turn that into 2 sentences
sean "If they're asking that question" <-- i think 'asking the question' works better than that
sean "path of understanding the solution." <-- i would go with "path to understanding"
sean "solve them problem themselves" <-- s/them /the /
sean "In most cases, if I'm talking to someone who has solved a problem,
sean they know more about the domain than I do, so asking a question that
sean implies the opposite is insulting. This is not to say that there's
sean anything wrong with asking a question, or discussing other possible
sean solutions, but it needs to be done in a way that is respectful of the
sean work that has already been done and acknowledges that the current
sean solution is based on knowledge and experience that I lack." <-- i'd break that up into more sentences
sean you're welcome
sean my thing is reprimanding all native americans who respond to thanks with "no problem"
john hey that's great!

john ah thanks!
john yeah, I operate similarly
derek I'm looking at making the ACE change to accept the new message format as well as the old wrapped form. I should be able to deploy that change, and then anytime after that release a version of JAS with the new amqp-client-core, correct?
sean thats quite the theme
john nice giving it a listen

#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: oh my god
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: that is the same thing as this:  echo '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
john oh hell yes
derek Just realized that there are 23 fields in Ken's MMN files, but we've always specified 22 in the bulk sync command. Any idea on what that might have impacted?
derek Yeah- it's custval101052. How can one correlate such field names with the Custom Fields listed in the ui?
john oh my god
john http://www.amazon.com/516-Long-Island-Hardcore-Compilation/dp/B000005YL2
john unsurprisingly not on rdio
derek Any idea why this is failing? Must be missing something- this is based on the transactional sender release I did yesterday, which was fine
derek http://paste:8080/paste?c=cp802

real_ruby hey Andy
real_ruby I was just wondering given you've done quite a few meetups here, you know how I go about organising one in the office?
real_ruby I have a study group
real_ruby and we need space from around 6:30-9 every week
mattjanks end of this month being the due date for beta.
real_ruby its not actually on meetup.com as I organised it with fellow hackerSchoolers
mattjanks i'll just keep trolling you here until you break down...
real_ruby oooh ok
real_ruby will get onto it
real_ruby thanks :)
real_ruby ok
real_ruby oh ok. I think I know who's coming
real_ruby it will be the same people every week
real_ruby I just hope they don't mind me doing it weekly
real_ruby ok will do!

#team-chaos-monkey < daniel> aturley, what does that mean?
derek Is the procedure for requeueing messages on failure queues (bluehornet-transactional-email.failures in particular) to use rmq-producer? Via --source-queue and --exchange?
john interesting
john ford was by far the most embarrassing failure of a project at bug
john for me anyway
john http://openxcplatform.com/host-devices/hardware.html
derek I'm looking at the "number" value in the bulk sync (number of columns) (I asked BH about it this morning and they're looking into it). I see legacy.clj reference API method "legacy.bulk_update", but their docs say "legacy.bulk_sync", with no mention of an alias. Obviously it works- do you recall if that's just an undocumented alias?
derek In this: http://paste:8080/paste?c=4mlra , it looks like bulk-sync in legacy.clj expects template-id as the second arg, but there's no template-id in the args as it's called, as seen above. Not sure how I'm misreading this.
jeremy haha. you're welcome
#team-chaos-monkey < jholder> aturley: Reading it now.
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: reading it later.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: repo with storm, in nexus with storm, not topology
joe hey buddy
joe is there a convenient repo for making changes to the job match email
joe using your nifty tool
joe i'm feeling like we started doing that after you guys got the job match email together
jeremy test emails?!
john so offhand...
john if you were tasked with getting bluehornet-job-application-email off of the db, and to start using recs service for recommendations...
john would you use recommendation-service-client?
john or just use an http client?
jeremy So about those test emails
john this shit pulls in dependencies on jax-rs, rest-client, jersey-client
derek Andy- do you know offhand where in the BH docs it talks about data types acceptable for transactional emails?
derek I'm experimenting with nested json for RL (unrelated to the data type question), and am wondering what might be wrong with this message/template combination (I didn't receive anything, but do without the a.a1 reference. http://paste:8080/paste?c=bskfu
derek I do see similarly-referenced values in other live templates
derek Ah- an error when trying to hit the storm qa ui
derek What runs for storm, apart from launching specific topologies?
derek What would cause the ui to say refused?
derek Is launching a topology all that's needed?
derek Ok, now that that box is back, I saw an error in the spout via the storm ui- was missing a closing brace in my json.  :O It went through when fixed.
derek Hmm- variables like "data": {"name":"Foo", "a":{"a1":{"a2":"a2 val"}}} aren't being resolved- just get blank in the message, using {$a.a1.a2} in the template. One less level, like I pasted before, was fine. Have to investigate after dentist now
kat My patience for Leo is at an all-time low as of earlier today.
kat They updated a library RL uses and then the metrics library stopped working for RL and he kept insisting that it was a problem with the metrics library that the "owner" of the metrics library needed to fix.
kat It got to the point where I told Hai that if he needed anything else to come talk to me and I just walked away.
kat Yep, that sounds about right.
kat haha Thanks. I am under no obligation to help them out other than trying to be a decent person/employee.
john could be worse. http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/Blog/2014/01/15/Two-men-robbed-of-marijuana-in-Taco-Bell-parking-lot-after-practicing-sword-fighting/6601389793411/?spt=sec&or=on
derek Is the entire hg bluehornet-scripts/bluehornet/ project deprecated? But not bluehornet-scripts/python? What about job-match/ in there?
derek But there's still some use in the python tools, no? If nothing else, for examples of stuff we may want to do in clojure?
derek Thanks- I'll check

derek Sounds good

sean these are the points when i start thinking someone is either in an intensive interview process or has a drug problem
sean the former i'm ok with, the latter would be sad
sean i haz worry
sean there is lolcat for that somewhere
sean all of that is stuff that has been covered in conclaves that he has never gone to
sean lots of deflecting where's john questions
#team-chaos-monkey < derek-at-home> ajurley- how's heidi doing?
derek-at-home Hi, sorry to hear it's chest-related. I don't recall if I've mentioned to you that I've had multiple heart surgeries? So very sympathetic to anything related to that.
derek-at-home Sorry to hear it. Glad they checked. Do they think it's something congenital?
derek-at-home Ah, then that sounds like a good thing, relatively. Not that it's more likely for the future, but related to the infection. I had a congenital bicuspid aortic valve, which they did a couple surguries on a couple years ago, with apparent suture problems after each. So then switched surgeons for the third, which is looking good, based on CT scan recently.
derek-at-home Yeah- they always ask about possible allergic reactions for that. After my last surgery 13 months ago I was on penicillin-based antibiotics, which it turns out I'm allergic to, after becoming delirious and re-admitting myself. You never know, I guess.

john you cloboling at clojure west?
john totally, though I haven't heard even the abstract
john heh, paste won't load at all for me, wtf
john other shit loads, just not paste
john probably runs on the mercurial box
john and there it goes

john okay
john I'm a little embarrassed it took me as long as it did to realize that the -> in (defn job-link->job [job-link]

john tht makes perfect sense
john i just started copying it
john then started looking up what -> means...
john but it makes it a hell of a lot more readable, anyway
derek Hey- hope the doctor goes well today
derek Btw, I'm looking to get in a repo various BH scripts I have, and wanted to clarify that the hg repo bluehornet-scripts should be considered legacy, right?
derek Could put scripts in whatever the related project is. E.g., the MMN repo
derek Yep, my newer stuff, like to create relational tables, etc.
derek Makes sense. I'll go down that road for now, at leasat
derek at least
sean well
sean you're moving soon
sean someone else's problem
sean ha
sean funny cos our entire system is LWW
sean as i said this morning to chesler... if we are going to do LWW then I'll stick with clusterix and  let them deal with the other crap around infrastrucutre
sean we need to do CRDT's
sean whether with riaks help with CRDT's or on top of cassandra

sean but thats what i figured

joydip i know which version the UA Airship uses
joydip it is usomg http code 4.2.4
joydip yes
joydip do I need to include that http core in my library's pom?
joydip so what do u suggest?
joydip haha that is called fat finger
joydip using
joydip i see
joydip storm uses 4.1.1
joydip i have to check
joydip actually first I got a different error
joydip java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/http/entity/ContentType
joydip when I included http core in my topology, I got the SSL error
joydip ok I'll check there
joydip that will be possible - but some extra work
joydip yes
joydip ok - I'll ask him next
joydip I thought u must have gone thru the same problem
joydip u r right, ContentType is not there in 4.1.1
joydip it sounds right, but I have to look up
joydip i was thiunking to see if an old version exists that might have same version as storm
joydip ur link is correct
joydip but vaguely remembering that I had to use this particular version - let me check
joydip yes
joydip no lock! all versions use the same http core
joydip ok r u one of the highly placed priests ? :)
mattjanks join the storm channel
mattjanks so we can talk as a group
#storm < joydip> aturley's link looks interesting
john got a minute?
john http://paste:8080/paste?c=po081
john I need to do that
john from clojure
john seems simple enough
john nice
john I just removed the generic and moved along
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturls: 
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturls: how about my clojure namespacing and imports?
sean so stephanie and her boss came to a "resignation" agreement
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturls: that worked
sean last day 2/21
sean non dispargement
sean 35k severance
sean so its ok
sean not great 
sean but abuot the best she would get
sean umm ... ?
sean hahahahaha
sean he's building something
sean i saw him giving gifts to dmitri
sean i hope he tries to steal him away
sean so my understanding
sean is that its vaguely caveer like
sean rate what people are good at
sean see where they have been
sean where they are going
sean learn from them on how to get there
sean with FUN FREE GAMIFICATION!
sean shoot me in the fucking head
sean fuck gamification
sean go fuck with someone else assholes
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: i was wondering what cemerick was talking about this morning
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unkIVvjZc9Y
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: no
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: i delete things from here and they dont show up when i open it in the office. apparently it always operates in split brain
john-at-home so my inagural experience with your clojure code is to rewrite an interop
john-at-home one word
john-at-home reflection
john-at-home so yeah
john-at-home Not going that well
john-at-home clojure does some compile-time magic
john-at-home I'm going to rewrite it
john-at-home I don't often have angry opinions about software, but I do now
john-at-home when, I ask you
john-at-home when
john-at-home I missed that
john-at-home I'm going to rewrite the recs client
john-at-home to serialize itself without needing to explicitly say "I expect to serialize myself"
john-at-home seriously it's insane
john-at-home when
john-at-home when would you use the recommndations service and not have it serialize to json?
john-at-home jackson is enough
sean-at-home so...
sean-at-home guess what i talked to ops about
Amig0 hey Andy
Amig0 quick q
Amig0 is there a way for me to manually create a message in rabbitmq to nudge storm topology
Amig0 looks like you are out. let me ping Sean
sean-at-home haha no
sean-at-home we are going to run our own fork of storm
Amig0 ah
Amig0 cool
Amig0 sounds promising :)
Amig0 Publish message?
sean-at-home because we keep running into this issue
Amig0 awesome
sean-at-home we cant depend on storm but be a slave to dll hell and have no control
Amig0 thx, i;ll try it
Amig0 ah yes?
Amig0 understood
Amig0 awesome
Amig0 thnx a lot
sean-at-home thats one
sean-at-home i hit another this morning
sean-at-home slf4j
sean-at-home so we can do it as we see fit
sean-at-home we can maintain a repo here
sean-at-home track the remote
sean-at-home and spin our rpms as needed and update
sean-at-home and control our future
sean-at-home and we make the choice of upgrade a dep or not judiciously
sean-at-home ITS A GOOD IDEA
sean-at-home judicious
sean-at-home if its just a dep upgrade that is one thing
sean-at-home actual code changes to support dep upgrade require a larger conversation around pro and con
sean-at-home ive maintained such branches before
sean-at-home dont worry
sean-at-home ive been burnt and learned lessons
sean-at-home i dont
sean-at-home all the stupid things in my life, i did
sean-at-home i cant trust that guy
sean-at-home ha
john-at-home i just don't get where we'd have a case where we wouldn't want, say, a RecommendationRequest to know how to serialize itself IF YOU'RE USING THE RECOMMENDATION CLIENT
john-at-home nope, gotta register a Jaxb ContextResolver in your own project to handle serialization of a class... that exists in a dependency
john-at-home seriously what would be the reasoning? I'm trying to think of it
john-at-home but it's true of all our clients
john-at-home someone must've said "this is a good idea" or punted
john-at-home done a lot of java serialization before
john-at-home never touched jaxb
john-at-home until theladders
john-at-home on the plus side i spent lunchtime making my own hummus
john-at-home and it's delicious, though the garlic needs like a day to cool off
john-at-home also
john-at-home derek sucks
john-at-home in that he just does shit and I have no idea about it and he doesn't communicate
john-at-home so I'm sucking you into a meeting
drew dude
kwinter yo
kwinter you there?
drew i'd like to take a look at which fields are going to be supplied by the recruiter service
drew do you have a file I could look at to easily answer that question?
kwinter haha
kwinter that's how we roll
kwinter tag teaming bitches
kwinter what's going in the recruiter service you're writing?
kwinter oooh, fancy
drew in the mobile app they also display the hiring alerts and some jobs
drew is that planed to be in here?
kwinter what you writing this shiznit in?
drew gatcha
drew any idea who i can ask about the other stuff?
kwinter little bit
kwinter it even has the secure ID in it? damn nice of you
kwinter bono
kwinter how specific to the Recruiter POV do you think it'll end up?
kwinter :)
kwinter probably start up end of next week
kwinter we currently have a ladders-recruiter library that does the same shit, and puts some business rules on top
kwinter dunno, I think we'll need to get together with Janks and figure out where some of our needs should live
kwinter but in the end, we'll be pulling jobs relevant to a Jobseeker, the Recruiter's saved searches, their activity, and maybe "Similar Recruiters"
drew ok thanks
kwinter yea
kwinter the jobs that recruiter has, that would be relevant to a particular jobseeker
kwinter don't know that would make sense in the service though
kwinter the lord of beer?
sean i need crack
sean or meth
sean or some fucking uppper

daniel Leo wants to add a repo to fisheye
daniel apparently a private key is required though

jruttenberg For Kyle's next birthday, let's see if we can get a Unix signal named after him: SIGKYLE
jruttenberg Who owns Unix these days? Is it still Novell?
jruttenberg I lost track. I guess that wouldn't cover Linux, anyway.
jruttenberg How is that done?
jruttenberg You are as wise as the day is long.
jruttenberg I think somebody in Shakespeare was called "as honest as the day is long," but I'm not sure.
jruttenberg It is pretty backhanded at any time of the year, if you think about it.

jtfmumm Here's a link to those soft synths I mentioned: http://elektrostudio.ovh.org
jtfmumm By the by, I've got names streaming in of hacker school people interested in the meetup
jtfmumm Yeah, I have four people so far and I'm sure more will hop on.  It's a topic I imagine a lot of people will be interested in
jtfmumm particularly in New York
mattjanks var geocircle = new Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geocircle(basicGeoposition, double);
mattjanks calling it GeographicCircle just to be different.
mattjanks did something just happen?
mattjanks remind me not to ignore an answer sean gives me.
mattjanks or at least not tell him i ignored it.
sean hey
sean can you put in a ticket to have recruiter service run with these... http://paste:8080/paste?c=fnj0e
sean and work out where that log file would go with chesler?
sean we'd want to do it for any service like that going forward
sean excellent
sean want to have it standard for everything we do
sean METRICS!

mattjanks Tell Sean we just got an email titled: "Important Meeting About Storm Applied"
mattjanks From Nicole Butterfield...
mattjanks I see he's back online.
mattjanks Nm :)
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: yea, this morning i edited my resolve.conf on my work box instead of my home computer by mistake 
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: what created the file?
jtfmumm We're up to 11 now
jtfmumm I'll put together an e-mail list in a few days after more names have come in
jtfmumm sure thing
#team-chaos-monkey < peter> aturley: https://github.com/TheLadders/runbooks/blob/master/recruiter-service.md <-- this is not a runbook. a usage guide
jruttenberg as opposed Jetty container applications -> as opposed to Jetty container applications
jruttenberg perhaps, "ops team" -> "Ops team" or "OPS" team
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: i see your video and raise.  http://vimeo.com/58200103
daniel so
daniel you're confirmed for tonight, right?
daniel so, you need to wash your hair
daniel I understand
daniel I'll try not to hold it against you
daniel I'll keep my smoldering rage in check
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley: I have a clojure/lein question.
mattjanks and here i was hoping to enjoy my monday.  GeographicalArea <- GeographicCircle pretty much eliminated any chance of that...
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley: got a minute?
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley: help?
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: got 2 seconds to unfuck my mind?
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: http://dgrove-work.laddersoffice.net/unstoppable.jpg
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: wishing on a star, and i guess it wouldn't make much sense to have a project called bluehornet-bulk-sync which allows you to call other legacy.* API calls... but I can't pass in, say, --api-call=legacy.delete_subscribers to that app eh?
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: ignore my troll
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley: are you going to the Papers We Love meetup?
sean-at-home yeah pot hanger?
sean-at-home o?
sean-at-home good to know
sean-at-home about what?
sean-at-home when?
sean-at-home so its this morning?
sean-at-home ok
sean-at-home k
sean-at-home ok
sean-at-home you and the drug references this morning
sean-at-home aight
sean-at-home see you later
sean-at-home talk about TheLadders
sean-at-home make em want to come work with us
sean-at-home that does not surprise me
sean-at-home this seems unlikely with manning cracking the whip
sean-at-home 3 chapters- 1 from each of us by m-w or whoever does get one done is off the book
sean-at-home i wrote 90% of chapter 1 for janks
sean-at-home and he is doing all the formatting in word to get to their spec, plus diagrams etc for chapters 1 and 5
jruttenberg-at-home How was the Cobol conf?
jruttenberg-at-home you were commenting in tcm about connecting basho and cobol. just a joke?
jruttenberg-at-home what would the half connection be?
jruttenberg-at-home I'm starting to think that the favored CS data structure is ethanol.
jruttenberg-at-home visions of organic chem dancing in my head
jruttenberg-at-home forgive me if I've already asked, but what are the cobol connections in your past?
jruttenberg-at-home oh, yes. now I remember. you have found a way to stand apart from the crowd in 2014.
jruttenberg-at-home how late were you in "Villy?"
jruttenberg-at-home Where does one drink in Villanova?
jruttenberg-at-home convenient. how many people at the conf?
jruttenberg-at-home what was the age distro like?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley had a problem earlier
jruttenberg-at-home hey, fella.
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg-at-home> aturley: you there?
jruttenberg-at-home there you are.
jruttenberg-at-home I would like to talk about testing my changes to bluehornet-application-confirmation-email.
jruttenberg-at-home yep
jruttenberg-at-home I've done the "don't send non-ladders emails when not in Prod."
jruttenberg-at-home I have written unit tests for the very small bits that aren't in the storm code. Those are good.
jruttenberg-at-home That code basically says: "not in prod? check the email address, etc."
jruttenberg-at-home Then, in the defbolt or whatever it is called (it's got an execute), I check the result of that call. If it is restricted, I just write a warn message and ack the tuple (Mott the Hoople?)
jruttenberg-at-home otherwise, proceed as usual.
jruttenberg-at-home I don't think I can test that part without running a storm cluster. correct?
jruttenberg-at-home the code in the execute of the bolt
jruttenberg-at-home hmm.
jruttenberg-at-home No, I want to check that it is properly integrated into the execute part of the bolt.
jruttenberg-at-home want to see the code fragment?
jruttenberg-at-home I rather thought so.
jruttenberg-at-home to the first thing
jruttenberg-at-home I don't know what is typical around here. If it makes sense to push the change and deploy to QA, I'm good with that.
jruttenberg-at-home http://paste:8080/paste?c=qeb3o
jruttenberg-at-home shut down what other topology?
jruttenberg-at-home ah
jruttenberg-at-home why would they interfere with each other?
jruttenberg-at-home got it.
jruttenberg-at-home I've do -> I would do?
jruttenberg-at-home that's it
jruttenberg-at-home they gave me the keys to the car but there isn't much gas in it.
jruttenberg-at-home This is what John told me to do.
jruttenberg-at-home Should we discuss whether this is the right approach?
jruttenberg-at-home that sounds somehow naughty
jruttenberg-at-home did you cleverly kick the ball over to sean and john and then slink away?
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg-at-home> aturley: I hope there is a spouse nearby to whack you in the head with a frying pan.
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg-at-home> aturley: oh, I thought heidi wanted to meet me for dinner and drinks.
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg-at-home> aturley, john-at-home, sean-at-home: I'm glad we've sorted this all out.
#riak <@tsantero> casio_juarez: sup
#riak <@tsantero> casio_juarez: yeah, if Vagabond's answers helped, awesome. since 2.0 is still in pre the docs are a WIP, and we can try to clear up any confusion about type/bucket level preference
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley: everything I need to know about software deployment I learned from Sesame Street
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley: got a minute?
jruttenberg nimbus sounds pretty stupid if it doesn't have anything short of re-deploy to cluster. just sayin'
jruttenberg Hmm, it doesn't pass the smell test for me. Re-deploying is all well and good, but the ability to restart a topology seems like something you would really want to be able to do. If not from a UI, then at the command line.
sean so here is the important question
sean is everyone around me going insane or am i going insane?
sean i dont know if john reached out to BH yesterday
sean we are seeing higher than normal levels of failures
sean nothing shocking but higher than normal
sean i changed by lightning talk
sean i dont remember the 10 minutes worth of cassandra i learned
kulc ha, apparently he excited for "Mother Russia" to retake it
kulc is it me or does that dog coughing sound human
sean SOOOOOOO.....
sean le sigh: https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-storm-user/201403.mbox/%3cCANMELZtEpk-uWoxUdepWOCPjemQCx9zt349K=t5UTnTpBBox-g@mail.gmail.com%3e
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley, sean: please take a look at http://fisheye.laddersoffice.com/cru/TCM-198  (changes to monitor-rabbitmq library)
sean "how is this really open source if i cant do whatever i want!!!!" 
sean it shouldnt be capped
sean i had missed that
sean get it changed
real_ruby hey Andy
real_ruby random question
real_ruby but can blue hornet cope with different bulk emails sent out in same period?
real_ruby I just wondered as I know we have days of the week for different emails
real_ruby ok
real_ruby hmm I wonder then
real_ruby I was reading about good days for surveys
real_ruby seems weekends aren't good
real_ruby yeah but also heard CSAT was being sent out on a sunday
real_ruby I'll ask Zhen after lunch
real_ruby (she's incharge of CSAT email)
real_ruby I thiought it was for tech reasons
real_ruby but thank you!
real_ruby ooh
real_ruby I thought it was marcs email and matches
real_ruby but not sure about csat
real_ruby anyway
sean cool to camille
sean amusing on the other
sean gary b?
#growth < kulc> aturley?
sean very blocked
#growth < kulc> aturley: uploaded a test file js_monthly_activity.1000.zip 35 columns
sean this is the part where i seriously consider writing to the non public api for set datatype
sean its going to be a shit show trying to do this without crdt's
#growth < joe> aturley ^
sean other option is fields grouping and pray that its replicated before next time
sean write own CRDT because praying aint gonna work
sean riak 2 client uses netty 4
sean storm 0.9.x uses netty 3.6
sean arg
sean hmmm
#growth < kulc> aturley, I fpt'd the main file
#growth < kulc> aturley, will you be providing me a file today?
sean ha
sean bad camille
sean did you try to recruit her?
sean less subtle
#growth < kulc> aturley, sounds like it's a non-issue
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=senor%20coconut
sean i do not
sean is he someone jonathan knows?
sean 1 strike
sean o?
sean yes
sean you have me laughing
sean yes
sean yes
sean reduce has been presented as an option for naming on twitter
sean what are we doing for lunch today?
sean think about lunch
sean and lets go talk about your bonus
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove-mac> aturley:  most like one is managed by puppet and the other isn't 
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler> aturley: it's because the ownership on ~ladders/.bashrc was explicitly declared, but ~bluehornet/.bashrc wasn't
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler> aturley: out of curiosity, why does it matter?  It's world readable, so you can view it.  Any changes you try to make will be overwritten in ~ 30 min
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler> aturley: part of the way puppet works is that the file will always change back to puppet's version of it.  If you want persistent changes, let me know what they are and I'll add them to the bashrc
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler> aturley: done
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler> aturley: how much of the bluehornet user's environment have you set up by hand?
john http://www.remotemagazine.com/internetofthings/
john you goin' bro?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: uhhhh. maybe
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: did you see my conversation with @lenary last night?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: also can you find out if we are sending enough job match emails now that BH is doing some throttling?
joe off the top of your head...
joe how crazy would it be to make an api call to bh after a user registers to just add the email to the them
joe that's what they are suggesting we do to solve the unsubscribe problem
joe Actaully this is a question for drew really
joe but I'm thinking the api call itself isn't that complicated
john btw what went into monthly active jobseekers?
john that doesn't sound so bad
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: ?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: what thing were you trying to say?
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: no i mean
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: no sorry neeed
john what the hell is sean even working on?
john ah
john suggested candidates => BH was "easy" too
john fucking hatch
#team-chaos-monkey < peter> aturley: help -> https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/scheduler/EvenScheduler.clj?source=c

john that's fucking tweetable
john sorry man

john i feel dirty
john i basically took a few teeth out with pliers and rolled it into the AFT gutter to see what happens

john yes
john wow she looks different with motherhood
john and yes, I heard that saachi and saachi
john did you get an email from peddicord asking if you were interested in freeboard, and if not, he'll remove you from the list?
john funny
john yeah I thought Tesia said she can't do it tonight though
john said next week sometime
john ah there's a little reunion thing going on
john i don't think i've got the energy, though i miss some of those peoples
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: we need cohorts
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: you work on the db timeout bit
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: actually
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: we can do it the old way
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: lets do hack
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: yes
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: so...
john no... maybe the next one or the one after that but i think it's best if i lay low and take 'er easy for a while. meetups and dinners only, etc
john you gonna go?
john nice
john at botanica?
jeremy look at this sweet test data http://cl.ly/image/3m0C3E1s061p/o  (especially the bottom one)
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: looks the same to me  http://goo.gl/gn6BeI
#team-chaos-monkey < daniel> aturley, I gave up on that talk half-way through
sean i'm not sure what the point of jonathan's other people chose to use something we arent email was
#team-chaos-monkey < dgrove> aturley: they are.  they're both crap

john http://paste:8080/paste?c=98nje
john creates gigs of intermediary garbage and never cleans up after itself... sean asks me to run it daily =/
john oh i'm marking and sweeping
john yeeepp
sean no the one he sent to dev team
sean about how he met people who picked DynamoDB instead of Riak because they wanted strong consistency.
sean other than maybe spreading FUD
sean what exactly does that accomplish?
sean my level of irritation with that one liner is quite high
sean jonathan
sean how so?
john haha, it's okay. it just came as a surprise when i was like "oh, okay, I want to run this cronjob daily instead of weekly. let me check and make sure that's not going to create any problems--OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS"
john i was actually going to have the script clean up its ancestors after it completes successfully
john like in Japan. "I've made it, Father. I am now a successful businessman. I will take you to Aokigahara now."
john csanders is leaving apparently
john he couldn't wait to tell me
john his eyelashes were fluttering with pleasure and pride, it was kinda funny
john no, he said he had an idea then drew rescued me by angrily spilling a package of chocolate chip cookies all over the countertop, giving me an exit
john eh, Tates... i can take it or leave it
john i'm a soft, freshly baked chocolate chip cookie or gtfo person
kat I wish I had a cookie! At least I haven't been at my desk so no one has been stopping by to ask me questions about RL.

kat The Internet disappoints me.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-in-training> aturley: we good on monitoring for tomorrow?
kat Yes, otherwise I'd just seem like a psycho.
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-in-training> aturley: i need to get up to work on book aturley, i got it
#team-chaos-monkey < sean-at-home> aturley: can you redeploy the bh sender just to be safe now that i moved the queue. it should reconnect fine but it would suck if it had an issue tomorrow morning.
#growth < john> aturley or derek-at-home, do you know if we have anything that wraps the utilities.getTasks api call?
mattjanks hey

#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg-at-home> aturley: private message coming atcha
jruttenberg-at-home got a minute?
jruttenberg-at-home no problem
jruttenberg-at-home the queue I am creating will be bound to an existing exchange?
jruttenberg-at-home yes
jruttenberg-at-home "event"?
jruttenberg-at-home and the binding has a routing key to select certain messages?
jruttenberg-at-home do you know what it needs to be?
jruttenberg-at-home ok. that was my next guess. thanks.
jruttenberg-at-home a warning: I keep saying job instead of jobservice. humor me or whack me with a fish, as you see fit.
jruttenberg-at-home I just downloaded the job-service code and then smacked my forehead.
jruttenberg-at-home if only women could be understanding when you use the wrong name...
mattjanks So we have this story: https://trello.com/c/YIQvHezM
mattjanks I added a basic checklist to research what each of the points in the description mean.
mattjanks I'm assuming this might require some coordination with you to some extent.
mattjanks In that maybe we want to be able to represent these states somehow with the data that you return.
mattjanks Instead of me trying to derive these states.
mattjanks Anyways, we can talk.
gundel i sure am
gundel what's up?
gundel we certainly can
gundel right, the whole batches/multiple starts thing
gundel yeah
gundel okay, gonna take these one at a time
gundel but backwards
gundel so, why not monitor the email queue?
gundel ah, got it
gundel presumably there's no possible case where jobseeker queue can ack messages that never make it to the email or transactional queue?
gundel alright, that's simple enough to deal with, it's easy to drop the emails queue monitoring
gundel though i can hold off until the email queue actually dies
gundel or is replaced
gundel yes and no
gundel start queue is used to determine when things should complete
gundel but really all that time knowledge is used for is to calculate an expected rate of ack-ing
gundel if the end time gets reset every 7 minutes it's no big deal, as long as the expected end time is far enough out from the last start
gundel right now that means the emails queue has 115 minutes to ack everything after the last start message comes in
gundel right
gundel jobseekers queue has a 30 minute time limit
gundel as it were
gundel it also looks at smaller windows to determine if there are problems, 4 instead of 5 minutes
gundel though that might still be too long at this point
gundel yeah, publish is almost instant
gundel well, i guess that's question 2
gundel what do you need to know about jobseeker queue?
john-at-home ho boi
gundel right now you've got an alert that'll go off if it doesn't hit 650 messages after any of the starts
gundel you've got the ack rate monitoring, which will still trigger if acking totally stops
gundel publish rate monitoring is kind of useless right now, but i can basically look at the single publish message and confirm it's the right size
gundel right now i'm talking about .jobseekers
gundel both are monitored
gundel though the .jobseeker stuff goes so quick that a bit of it is probably futile at the moment
gundel more because i look at a set of values to determine if something is wrong, for jobseekers it's over a 4 minute period
gundel i can turn that down to 1 minute, then if any metric is ever low alert will trigger
gundel instead of needing some consistency
gundel though a minute is as low as i can turn it for the reason you mentioned
gundel sure thing
gundel i think it should be fairly thorough
gundel if the publish rate is low, you'll get an alert
gundel if you don't have at least 650 messages, alert
gundel ack rate not high enough to clear out the queue in 30 minutes, alert
gundel and unrelated, but if the start queue chokes or jobseekers doesn't start after the start queue triggers, also alerts
gundel anything i might be missing?
gundel bitchin'
gundel i'll push the change to the .jobseekers monitoring window shortly
gundel btw, is that 30 minutes time to clear for jobseekers appropriate?
gundel or does it need to complete faster?
gundel last send right now starts at about 7:35
gundel yeah, of course
gundel but when is zero hour for it?
gundel when does alex start sending disappointed emails?
gundel can i equate "should" with "better fucking do it or heads will roll"?
gundel alerts are not to be used lightly
gundel five minutes it is then
gundel yeah, i'm not bumping this to pagers quite yet
gundel that might actually be short enough to watch every send on its own
gundel but again, it's all a factor of how many messages are on the queue, so it shouldn't alert unless there really is a problem
gundel since the queue does seem to clear completely between each jobseekers batch
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg-at-home> aturley: you there?
gundel jobseeker queue monitoring number updates released
kat hey, just an FYI, we've started work on recruiter sign up
mattjanks https://trello.com/c/YIQvHezM
#team-chaos-monkey < gundel> aturley: need to bump the expected run time on send-job-match-emails-via-bluehornet.jobseekers queue to 6 minutes, it hit a race condition this morning
kat Good morning!
kat I don't know if you saw my message yesterday or if Matt said anything to you, but we've begun working on recruiter sign up

#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley, jruttenberg :
mattjanks oh wait until you see the underlying table structure for this crap...
mattjanks hahaha
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler> aturley: so it's 1.1.0?
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler-at-home> aturley: http://fpaste.org/85162/37086139/
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler-at-home> aturley: 0.1.7 is up and running again in QA.  The only difference between before and now is that the GC logging bits are in place

mattjanks good news.  i ripped out the secure-id depedency in auth service.
mattjanks nope.  it was being used for generating hypermedia links.
mattjanks which we aren't doing any more for recruiters.
mattjanks those links were for the old recruitable mobile app...
mattjanks why the auth service was generating those i have no idea.
mattjanks that's like the jobseeker service generating links for our mobile app...
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler-at-home> aturley: I'm going to be afk for a bit.  mention my name when you have a new version ready
mattjanks this has inspired me to rip out as many unneeded dependencies as possible.
mattjanks especially ones with the name "cache" in them.
#mobile < thomas> aturley right now: http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/1a/02/b5/1a02b5c285854a500fe56f0b26d26157.jpg
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler-at-home> aturley: looks good to me.  let me know when you'd like me to do the other envcs
#team-chaos-monkey < mchesler-at-home> aturley: done
sean ha
#mobile < thomas> aturley pointed me to http://www.sbnation.com/2013/7/23/4549340/the-gif-oracle for all my gif needs
#team-chaos-monkey < sean> aturley: no
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: wanna give this a quick glance?
john hehe
john "interact"
john InteractWithFriends
john haha yeah I saw that
john I didn't see any pictures though, I read it on the subway
john missed the racist overtones
#team-chaos-monkey < jruttenberg> aturley: oops, I typed it wrong.

john and it includes, apparently, interactions with the webui.
sean this is starting to feel like a job for erlang
john It’s significantly easier to work with within most programming languages as well.  Just take a look at this simple PHP code for working with some JSON from Datafiniti:

john you?
john i guess that means it's time for that picnic table, eh?
john haha
john ah shit
john I keep meaning to put the replacement iphone4 apple gave me... it was a refurb and the wifi is defective. wifi went out like 3 days after I got it... which was like 8 months ago.
john put it in my bag, I meant

#mobile < mattjanks> aturley, is there any logging in the recruiter service?
mattjanks first integration test run attempt:  http://paste:8080/paste?c=lf8nj
mattjanks i was going to look through the logs but can't find any.
#team-chaos-monkey < john> aturley: we're good
mchesler yup
mchesler should be all set
mchesler my pleasure
mchesler You'd have to ask helpdesk for a static DHCP assignment and DNS entry
mchesler that's abiola's world, not ours
mchesler once that's done, just enable remote login through system preferences
sean you know about ken right?
sean k
sean just makking sure
sean i have much sadness
sean i tried

kulc definitely, you too
kulc funny bunch you the platform team is
